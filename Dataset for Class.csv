Despite the importance of this period in their daily activity budget, we lack information about rest/roost ecology for most animals, including the imperiled lesser prairie-chicken (Tympanuchus pallidicinctus; hereafter LEPC). Therefore, we sought to identify how landcover, anthropogenic features, and human policy (i.e., presence of the Conservation Reserve Program [CRP]) influenced roost site selection and movement patterns of the LEPC. From March to May 2013-2015, we captured and fitted GPS transmitters to 106 LEPCs (n = 72 males; n = 34 females) within Beaver County, Oklahoma and recorded two nocturnal locations per 24-hour period, annually. We used discrete choice models and generalized linear mixed effects models to determine how vegetation cover, CRP patches, and anthropogenic features influenced roost site selection and movements to roosting sites, respectively. We found that roost sites were closer to CRP, leks, and croplands than would be expected at random. Conversely, roost sites were located farther away from shortgrass prairie, roads, and transmission lines than expected. The probability of a LEPC roosting in a location increased by 15% and 4.5% for every 36-meter decrease in distance to a CRP patch and distance to their lek of capture, respectively. Similarly, individuals roosting in CRP patches would travel shorter distances to get to roost sites if their last diurnal location was near CRP. Bird's movements to roosts in CRP were 1.4 times shorter for every meter decrease in the distance of their last diurnal location to a CRP patch, indicating that individuals modify their movement based on CRP presence. Our results indicate that CRP is influential to roosting ecology of the LEPC within this region and may be meeting critical cover requirements.","[Tanner, Evan P.; Tanner, Ashley M.] Texas A&M Univ, Caesar Kleberg Wildlife Res Inst, 700 Univ Blvd,MSC 218, Kingsville, TX 78363 USA; [Tanner, Evan P.; Tanner, Ashley M.; Fuhlendorf, Samuel D.; Elmore, R.

The typical spatial conservation planning process leading to the creation of these protected areas focuses on representation and replication of ecological features, often using decision support tools such as Marxan. Yet, despite the important role ecological connectivity has in metapopulation persistence and resilience, Marxan currently requires manual input or specialized scripts to explicitly consider connectivity. 'Marxan Connect' is a new open source, open access Graphical User Interface (GUI) tool designed to assist conservation planners with the appropriate use of data on ecological connectivity in protected area network planning. Marxan Connect can facilitate the use of estimates of demographic connectivity (e.g. derived from animal tracking data, dispersal models, or genetic tools) or structural landscape connectivity (e.g. isolation by resistance). This is accomplished by calculating metapopulation-relevant connectivity metrics (e.g. eigenvector centrality) and treating those as conservation features or by including the connectivity data as a spatial dependency amongst sites in the prioritization process. Marxan Connect allows a wide group of users to incorporate directional ecological connectivity into conservation planning with Marxan. The solutions provided by Marxan Connect, combined with ecologically relevant post-hoc testing, are more likely to support persistent and resilient metapopulations (e.g. fish stocks) and provide better protection for biodiversity.","[Daigle, Remi M.; Metaxas, Anna; Balbar, Arieanna C.] Dalhousie Univ, Dept Oceanog, Halifax, NS, Canada; [Daigle, Remi M.] Univ Laval, Dept Biol, Quebec City, PQ, Canada; [McGowan, Jennifer; Kuempel, Caitlin D.] Univ Queensland, Sch Biol Sci, Ctr Excellence Environm Decis, St Lucia, Qld, Australia; [McGowan, Jennifer] Nature Conservancy, 1815 N Lynn St, Arlington, VA USA; [Treml, Eric A.] Deakin Univ, Sch Life & Environm Sci, Ctr Integrat Ecol, Geelong, Vic, Australia; [Treml, Eric A.] Univ Melbourne, Sch BioSci, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Possingham, Hugh P.] Nature Conservancy, South Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Beger, Maria] Univ Leeds, Sch Biol, Fac Biol Sci, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England; [Beger, Maria] Univ Queensland, Sch Biol Sci, Ctr Excellence Environm Decis, Brisbane, Qld, Australia",remi.daigle@dal.ca,37,25,25,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2041-210X,METHODS ECOL EVOL,Methods Ecol.

These use snapshots of systems to support decision-making. However, ignoring the dynamic nature of systems can result in misleading spatial prioritisations and missed opportunities to encourage participation in conservation programmes. Using a modelling approach, we show that integrating economic and ecological feedbacks into conservation planning improved social and ecological outcomes. We developed an approach that enabled accounting for feedbacks of farmland set-asides using a popular conservation planning tool. We empirically assessed the impact of ignoring feedbacks on plans to restore the Brazilian Atlantic Forest by comparing outcomes of our approach and a widely used static approach. The proposed approach attained better conservation outcomes than a static approach, at about 7% lower cost, while also allowing more farmers to benefit economically from the set-aside scheme through capitalising on the differences between their opportunity costs and the amount paid by the scheme. Accounting for feedbacks led to substantially different areas being prioritised for farmland set-asides, and to more farmers being included in the set-aside scheme. These results show important benefits from understanding, and then working with, feedbacks that inevitably accompany large-scale conservation interventions. Our approach is the first to integrate both environmental and economic feedbacks into spatial conservation planning, and model information rent capture. In doing so, it demonstrates how existing economic incentives can be used to encourage farmers to join a conservation set-aside, while still resulting in a lower overall intervention cost.","[Larrosa, Cecilia; Carrasco, Luis R.] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Biol Sci, 14 Sci Dr 4, Singapore 117543, Singapore; [Larrosa, Cecilia; Banks-Leite, Cristina] Imperial Coll London, Dept Life Sci, Silwood Pk Campus,Buckhurst Rd, Ascot SL5 7PY, Berks, England; [Larrosa, Cecilia; Milner-Gulland, E.

One such approach is based on ecosystems and the concept of ecological integrity, although myriad ways exist to measure ecological integrity. To describe our ecosystem-based index of ecological integrity (IEI) and its derivative index of ecological impact (ecoImpact), and illustrate their applications for conservation assessment and planning in the northeastern United States. We characterized the biophysical setting of the landscape at the 30 m cell resolution using a parsimonious suite of settings variables. Based on these settings variables and mapped ecosystems, we computed a suite of anthropogenic stressor metrics reflecting intactness (i.e., freedom from anthropogenic stressors) and resiliency metrics (i.e., connectivity to similar neighboring ecological settings), quantile-rescaled them by ecosystem and geographic extent, and combined them in a weighted linear model to create IEI. We used the change in IEI over time under a land use scenario to compute ecoImpact. We illustrated the calculation of IEI and ecoImpact to compare the ecological integrity consequences of a 70-year projection of urban growth to an alternative scenario involving securing a network of conservation core areas (reserves) from future development. IEI and ecoImpact offer an effective way to assess ecological integrity across the landscape and examine the potential ecological consequences of alternative land use and land cover scenarios to inform conservation decision making.","[McGarigal, Kevin; Compton, Bradley W.; Plunkett, Ethan B.; DeLuca, William V.; Jackson, Scott D.] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Environm Conservat, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; [Grand, Joanna] Natl Audubon Soc, Div Sci, Northampton, MA 01060 USA; [Ene, Eduard] Ecol Software Solut, Waterloo, ON N2T 2M7, Canada",mcgarigalk@eco.umass.edu; bcompton@eco.umass.edu; eplunkett@eco.umass.edu; wdeluca@eco.umass.edu; jgrand@audubon.org; gispro@gmail.com; sjackson@umass.edu,46,16,16,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-2973,LANDSCAPE ECOL,Landsc.

However, whether the public-oriented nature education can also indirectly reach out to benefit employees, namely, employees' informal learning in nature education, remains understudied. The present study addressed this gap by making a preliminary exploration in fifteen nature reserves in China with an online survey, and we found that employees could be positively affected by informally acquired nature education in terms of increased self-reported ecological conservation behaviors. Besides, we revealed the underlying mechanism that drives this positive effect-employees' indirectly acquired nature education could increase their environmental competence, leading to improved self-efficacy, which in turn elevates ecological conservation behaviors. We thereby discussed the implications of these results, offered practical suggestions for policy making, management practice and employees' selfenhancing, and we also identified directions for future research.","[Gong, Yuanchao; Sun, Yan] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Psychol, Key Lab Behav Sci, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Gong, Yuanchao; Sun, Yan] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Dept Psychol, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Li, Yang] Beijing Technol & Business Univ, Sch Business, Beijing 100048, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Linxiu] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Key Lab Ecosyst Network Observat & Modelling, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Linxiu] United Nations Environm Programme Int Ecosyst Man, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China",suny@psych.ac.cn,64,0,0,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",,GLOB ECOL CONSERV,Glob.

However, these views may not always be shared by people who live alongside wildlife and are the intended beneficiaries of the incentives. Such misalignments can undermine the effectiveness of conservation efforts to motivate pro-conservation behavior. In Samburu, Kenya, an area with multiple active international conservation programs, we sought to assess local residents' perspectives regarding three factors known to influence pro-environmental behavior: (a) ecological knowledge, including views on wildlife abundance and extinction risk; (b) perceptions of agency regarding wildlife conservation (here defined as the ability of humans to influence wildlife populations); and (c) personal motivations for wildlife conservation. We interviewed 74 residents and evaluated whether their perspectives aligned with the premises and assumptions that underpin the strategies commonly used by international organizations to promote wildlife conservation in the area. We found that concepts of rarity and extinction based on Western-based science were not salient in how residents thought about local wildlife populations. Consistent with core assumptions of Western conservation programs, however, most residents did feel a sense of agency to influence wildlife populations, and reported economic incentives as primary motivations for conservation. We conclude with cautionary notes regarding tacit assumptions made when promoting wildlife conservation in other cultures, and the ethics and potential unintended consequences of 'motivation crowding' by powerful exogenous agents.","[Heisel, Sara E.; King, Elizabeth] Univ Georgia, Ctr Integrat Conservat Res, 321 Hunter Holmes Bldg,101 Herty Dr, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Heisel, Sara E.; King, Elizabeth; Malsbury, Erin] Univ Georgia, Odum Sch Ecol, 140 E Green St, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [King, Elizabeth] Univ Georgia, Warnell Sch Forestry & Nat Resources, 180 E Green St, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Lekanta, Francis; Lemerketo, Isaya] Samburu Youth Educ Fund, 640 Peterson St, Ft Collins, CO 80524 USA; [Lemoile, Francis] SAFE Samburu, POB 610-60300, Isiolo, Kenya; [Ryan, Camilla] Earlham Inst, Norwich Res Pk, Norwich NR4 7UZ, Norfolk, England; [Sundaresan, Siva] Greater Yellowstone Coalit, 215 5 Wallace Ave, Bozeman, MT 59715 USA; [Bruyere, Brett] Colorado State Univ, Dept Human Dimens Nat Resources, Campus Delivery 1480, Ft Collins, CO 80521 USA; [Heisel, Sara E.] Washington Univ, Dept Anthropol, 1 Brookings Dr, St Louis, MO 63130 USA",seheisel@wustl.edu,53,1,1,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0006-3207,BIOL CONSERV,Biol.

Poland typifies this distribution, with bears being present in the Carpathian Mountains, but absent from the lowlands. Recently large carnivore populations have been recovering throughout Europe, raising the question of the potential for bears to recolonize both the Polish and wider central European lowlands. The nearest population with good connectivity to the Polish lowlands is in central Belarus, where bears are currently expanding. In recent years there have been at least two undocumented sightings of bears in eastern Poland, such as in Bialowieza Forest in 2010 and Augustow Forest in 2018. While carrying out a camera trap study in June 2019, we documented the first brown bear in the Polish part of Bialowieza Forest since 1963. The individual apparently left for the Belarusian side of the forest, where a bear continued to be spotted several times over the following month. After over half a year of no signs of bears, on the April 1, 2020, a bear was recorded again on the Belarusian side of the forest. It is unknown whether this was the same individual. If the brown bear population in Belarus continues to expand, such visits of bears to eastern Poland are likely to become increasingly frequent in the near future. This could lead to the eventual reestablishment of the species in Bialowieza Forest and the wider central European lowlands, restoring a diverse array of ecological interactions, while having significant and complex management implications. We briefly review the ecosystem impacts of bears in their natural ranges and discuss potential conservation management issues that would need to be dealt with in order to minimise potential conflicts, honour legal obligations and conserve the species.

We explore several examples where detailed mechanistic understanding of the physiological constraints of keystone and foundational species, ecological service providers such as insect pollinators, and species of conservation concern has been used to optimize the return of these species to landscapes following the cessation of mineral extraction. Using such data can optimize the rapid return of functioning ecosystems during restoration or increase the conservation value of restoration by returning insurance populations of threatened species. Integrating this level of mechanistic understanding with fine-resolution spatial data in the form of biophysical modeling can help plan recovery and identify targets that can subsequently be used in assessing restoration success, particularly in situations that require substantial investment over long periods, such as post-mining restoration. There is growing recognition of the valuable insights offered by conservation physiology to broader practice and policy development, and there have been substantial technical developments in conservation physiology leading up to and into the twenty-first century as a result. The global challenge facing restoration ecology has, however, also grown in that time. Rapidly and efficiently meeting ambitious global restoration objectives will require a targeted approach, and we suggest that the application of physiological data will be most strategic for rare species, keystone species, and ecosystem service providers more broadly.","[Tomlinson, Sean] Univ Adelaide, Sch Biol Sci, North Terrace, Adelaide, SA 5000, Australia; [Tomlinson, Sean; Tudor, Emily P.] Curtin Univ, Sch Mol & Life Sci, Bentley, WA 6102, Australia; [Tomlinson, Sean; Tudor, Emily P.; Turner, Shane R.; Stevens, Jason; Lewandrowski, Wolfgang] Dept Biodivers Conservat & Attract, Kings Pk Sci, Kings Pk, WA 6005, Australia; [Tudor, Emily P.; Turner, Shane R.; Riviera, Fiamma; Stevens, Jason; Lewandrowski, Wolfgang] Univ Western Australia, Sch Biol Sci, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia; [Turner, Shane R.; Cross, Sophie; Riviera, Fiamma; Stevens, Jason] Curtin Univ, Sch Mol & Life Sci, ARC Ctr Mine Site Restorat, Bentley, WA 6102, Australia; [Valliere, Justin] Calif State Univ Dominguez Hills, Dept Biol, Carson, CA 90747 USA",sean.tomlinson@adelaide.edu.au,101,0,0,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1061-2971,RESTOR ECOL,Restor.

The 10th Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) in 2010 set global targets for the areal extent of protected areas (PAs) that were met partially in 2020, yet a new, more ambitious target is needed to halt ongoing global biodiversity loss. China recently introduced a national Ecological Conservation Redline policy, which aims to ensure no net change in land cover and no net loss of biodiversity or degradation of ecosystem services within areas that are critical for maintaining ecological safety and functions. Enacting this policy could achieve ancillary conservation outcomes even where conservation is not the primary objective, thus meeting CBD's definition of other effective area-based conservation measures (OECM). By comparing the Ecological Conservation Redline boundaries with important coastal waterbird sites in China, we found that three times more sites could be conserved under the new redline policy compared to the national nature reserve system alone. This indicates that considering the redline policy approach as a form of OECM is a promising pathway to expand the areal coverage of PAs and conserve biodiversity outside currently designated PAs, providing a model that could be adopted around the world.","[Choi, Chi-Yeung; Gibson, Luke] Southern Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Environm Sci & Engn, Shenzhen, Peoples R China; [Shi, Xu; Fuller, Richard A.] Univ Queensland, Sch Biol Sci, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Shi, Xu] Univ Exeter, Ctr Ecol & Conservat, Penryn, England; [Shi, Jianbin] Beijing Normal Univ, Sch Environm, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Gan, Xiaojing] Paulson Inst, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Wen, Chujun; Zhang, Jiawei] Crossborder Environm Concern Assoc, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Jackson, Micha V.] Univ Adelaide, Sch Biol Sci, Adelaide, SA, Australia",biodiversity@sustech.edu.cn,33,0,0,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1755-263X,CONSERV LETT,Conserv.

The geographical weighted regression considering local parameters was used to explore the trade-offs/synergies, and the geographical detector utilizing spatial heterogeneity was applied to quantitatively identify their driving factors. Results show that:(1) trade-offs and synergies were present between these three ES in space, and the SC and CS show marked synergies which characterized more than 80% of each ECRL area; (2) in the ECRL areas of Beijing, the synergies of the three pairs of ES was most sensitive to terrain factors. The determinants of the spatial trade-offs between SC and WY, SC and CS, and WY and CS are potential evapotranspiration, precipitation, and temperature, respectively; (3) compounding effects of nonlinear enhancement exists between the environmental factors. The interaction between precipitation and other factors had the greatest explanatory power on the trade-offs/synergies between SC and WY.

After broadening our literature search, we were able to identify a new emphasis on management-related research and research in the fields of disease ecology, social science, and methodological development. Critical knowledge gaps remain, however, as there was still a significant lack of studies on herptiles, arthropods, and fish.

We review the benefits that sensory ecology can bring to wildlife conservation and management by discussing case studies across major taxa and sensory modalities. Conservation practices informed by a sensory ecology approach include the amelioration of sensory traps, control of invasive species, reduction of human-wildlife conflicts and relocation and establishment of new populations of endangered species.

Yet we still know little of how horses contribute to key ecological interactions including predator-prey and indirect competitive relationships at a community level. Notably, feral species like horses can exhibit life-history traits that differ from that of native (mainly artiodactyl) herbivore competitors. Artificial selection for traits like increased, early, or extended reproduction that have yet to be reversed by natural selection, coupled with naturally selected differences in anatomy and behavior, in addition to unique management objectives for horses compared to other species, means that the dynamics of feral horse populations are not likely to align with what might be expected of other large herbivores. Unexpected population dynamics and inherent biological asymmetries between native ungulates and feral horses may therefore influence the former via direct competition for shared resources and through enemy-mediated interactions like apparent competition. In several localities feral horses now co-exist with multiple native prey species, some of which are in decline or are species at risk. Compounding risks to native species from direct or indirect competitive exclusion by horses is the unique nature and socio-political context of feral horse management, which tends towards allowing horse populations to be limited largely by natural, density-dependent factors. We summarize the inherent asymmetries between feral horse biology and that of other ungulate prey species with consequences for conservation, focusing on predator-prey and emerging indirect interactions in multi-prey systems, and highlight future directions to address key knowledge gaps in our understanding of how feral horses may now be contributing to the (re)structuring of food webs. Observations of patterns of rapid growth and decline, and associated skews in sex ratios of feral horse populations, indicate a heightened potential for indirect interactions among large ungulate prey species, where there is a prevalence of feral horses as preferred prey, particularly where native prey are declining. In places like western North America, we expect predator-prey interactions involving feral horses to become an increasingly important factor in the conservation of wildlife. This applies not only to economically or culturally important game species but also at-risk species, both predators (e.g., wolves [Canis lupus], grizzly bears [Ursus arctos]) and prey (e.g., woodland caribou [Rangifer tarandus caribou]), necessitating an ecological understanding of the role of horses in natural environments that goes beyond that of population control.

By analyzing and describing the movements and use of the space, as well as the interactions among individual jaguars, we can better understand their behavioral differences, habitat use, and home range. This type of information is critical for the development and implementation of effective and appropriate conservation strategies. We identified home range size for 14 jaguars in a 13-year period and described the interspecific relations and use of space by the percentages of overlap of the territories between individuals. Collectively, the average home range size was larger than 200 km(2), ranging from 48 to 633 km(2) and averaging 296 km(2) for males varied and 37-435 km(2), with an average of 148 km(2), for females. However, home range sizes did not differ significantly among males or females. Male territory overlapped about 3.3% on average (range 2.5-15.5%), suggesting that most of the time males avoid each other. Average overlap of female territory was 12%, ranging from 7 to 100%. Males share an average of 18% (range 2-56%) of its territory and with up to five females, suggesting that a given male may be related to all of them at certain periods of time. There were no seasonal changes (dry and rainy seasons) in home range sizes for both male and females.

Accordingly, the socio-ecological system (SES), which emphasizes the interplay between environmental and social dynamics, seems to be the appropriate framework for analysis. We applied this view to explore issues concerning the conservation of the remnant forests of the peri-urban area of Bogota (Colombia). Specifically, we characterized this territory as a SES through a parsimonious set of fundamental, across-domain variables. Using elicitation-based information we reconstructed interactions between these variables so that their interactive network could be visualized as alternative signed digraphs. We analyzed these models by Loop Analysis to show that exploiting the structure of the interactions may help disentangling causative mechanisms for the response of remnant forests and other components of this SES to natural events (loss of soil fertility), policies (subsidizing industrial production) and social events (internal migration, social activism) that we assumed as potential drivers of change. Our results highlight that integrating ecological and social variables in a unique interactive network can reveal important causal linkages that make remnant forests unexpectedly vulnerable to certain drivers but also that unexpected beneficial effects may occur, clarifying why same drivers of change can be responsible for both deforestation and forest regrowth. Overall, the analysis reveals that trade-offs between desirable ecological and social outcomes are the rule and that potential win-win outcomes across the triple-bottom line of the sustainable development paradigm are difficult to achieve.","[Rodriguez, Maykol; Clerici, Nicola] Univ Rosario, Fac Nat Sci, Dept Biol, Carrera 24 63C-69, Bogota 111221, Colombia; [Bodini, Antonio] Univ Parma, Dept Chem Life Sci & Environm Sustainabil, Viale Sci 11-A, Parma, Italy; [Escobedo, Francisco J.] US Forest Serv, Urban Ecosyst & Social Dynam, Pacific Southwest Res Stn, 125 Paseo Plaza,Suite 204, Los Angeles, CA 90012 USA",maykol.rodriguez@urosario.edu.co; antonio.bodini@unipr.it; Francisco.Escobedo@usda.gov; nicola.clerici@urosario.edu.co,77,1,1,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0304-3800,ECOL MODEL,Ecol.

Therefore, the ECR became a key part of national ecological security. Three major types of area are covered by the ECR so that important ecosystem functions can be protected. These are ecologically fragile zones, biodiversity, and natural landscapes. The ECR is characterized as being fundamental, systematic, and mandatory. This study summarizes the developmental background, theoretical framework, and structural composition of ECR, and highlights recent advances. A comparison of the ECR to international protected areas showed that they were generally similar, but there were differences in the methods used to protect targets, their system design, and their management, which provided insights and recommendations that could improve the construction and management of protected areas in the future. These included: (1) increasing the integrity of ecological protection by replacing dispersed protection with a more comprehensive and systematic approach, (2) increasing the spatial accuracy of protection to enhance the effectiveness of protection, and (3) implementing an overall-process management to guarantee the sustainability of protection.

The present study therefore aimed at addressing this gap through application of an extended form of Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) in order to examine the determinants of Iranian farmers' ecological conservation behavior regarding the use of IPM practices. This research was a descriptive, causal, and correlational study conducted through a cross-sectional survey of 327 tomato growers in Zanjan Province of Iran. The results disclosed that the growers utilize various IPM practices (cultural, mechanical, chemical, and biological); nevertheless, the majority of growers were grouped in relatively low or low level of IPM practices' usage. The key propositions of the original TAM, i.e., attitude, perceived usefulness, and perceived ease of use, explained 41.3% of the variance in the farmers' ecological conservation behavior regarding IPM practices' application. Moreover, the extended TAM was appropriate for the prediction of effective factors of farmers' ecological conservation behavior concerning the use of IPM practices. Also, adding the four constructs of social influence, result demonstrability, compatibility, and self-efficacy, significantly enhanced the stability and explanatory power of the original TAM (from 41.3% to 46.4%). In the extended TAM, result demonstrability (beta = 0.182) and compatibility (beta = 0.360) had significant positive impacts on perceived usefulness; while, self-efficacy had a meaningful positive effect on perceived ease of use (beta = 0.776), and had not any impact on perceived usefulness (beta = 0.114). The findings of this study expanded the current body of knowledge on technology acceptance via the investigation of TAM in a novel ecological conservation technology field (i.e., the IPM technology) and provided a roadmap for better understanding of decisive factors affecting farmers' ecological conservation behavior as well as post-implementation interventions aiming at IPM technology promotion in developing countries.

This concept focuses attention on limiting factors that affect the tolerance of systems or organisms and changes in them. Accumulating empirical evidence for the existence of ecological thresholds has created favorable conditions for practical application to wildlife conservation. Applying the concept has the potential to enhance conservation of two large carnivores, Amur tiger and leopard, and the knowledge gained could guide the construction of a proposed national park. In this review, ecological thresholds that result from considering a paradigm of bottom-up control were evaluated for their potential to contribute to the conservation of Amur tiger and leopard. Our review highlights that large carnivores, as top predators, are potentially affected by ecological thresholds arising from changes in climate (or weather), habitat, vegetation, prey, competitors, and anthropogenic disturbances. What's more, interactions between factors and context dependence need to be considered in threshold research and conservation practice, because they may amplify the response of ecosystems or organisms to changes in specific drivers. Application of the threshold concept leads to a more thorough evaluation of conservation needs, and could be used to guide future Amur tiger and leopard research and conservation in China. Such application may inform the conservation of other large carnivores worldwide. (C) 2019 The Authors.

In this paper, we used a multisource data approach to assess ES, performed downscaling to a 1 x 1 km(2) grid size, and applied spatial statistics to analyze the ES pattern in the PRD. We found three natural ecological buffers, namely, nature reserves and forest patches covering several municipalities in the delta, thus guaranteeing the socio-economic development of this highly urbanized area. The spatial autocorrelation results indicated that the ES pattern is significantly spatially correlative (p = 0.001), with a Moran's I of 0.7766. We identified several hot and cold spots for the ES spatial distribution that occupied 58.49% of the PRD's total area. Moreover, a semivariance analysis showed that structural factors are dominant in the ES spatial distribution. Based on the ES area proportions, the 9 municipalities of the PRD can be grouped into three categories: optimized development zones, comprehensive development zones, and ecological conservation development areas.

In this paper, I explore different strands of CHE in the study of tribal, artisanal, and small-scale industrial fisheries from the mid-90s onward that can contribute to the foundational knowledge necessary for designing and implementing successful coastal fisheries management and conservation programs. Marine conservation has often failed due to a lack of understanding of the fine grained marine human-environmental interactions at the local scale. In this context, I also examine developing and future research directions in CHE, and discuss their potential contribution for filling the gap in existing approaches to actionable scholarship in marine conservation.

Wild species are arriving by natural or human-mediated range expansion, at times reclaiming ranges from which they were lost centuries ago. Recent colonizers include alien invasives and species expanding their historical distribution without direct human assistance. These events can deepen our understanding of contemporary evolution, including wildlife responses to changing climatic conditions. Rewilding can advance conservation genomics by encouraging study of wildlife in environments where these species represent novel arrivals or return after prolonged absences. Such efforts could facilitate more experimental approaches to research design than that typically feasible for landscape-scale ecological and evolutionary studies. Correspondingly, developments in conservation genomics offer unparalleled means for testing predictions about rewilding, and advancing evolutionary enlightened and proactive conservation planning.

To systematize the available knowledge, we conduct a review of 51 studies addressing local ecological knowledge (LEK) and forest biodiversity conservation practice. We analyze what specific kind of knowledge is considered, who holds the knowledge, how this knowledge is actively applied in practice and how it relates to biodiversity conservation. The review shows that local ecological knowledge and forest biodiversity conservation are linked through various socially shared aspects, such as values and norms, spiritual beliefs and perceptions of ecosystem functions and benefits as well as operational conditions, including livelihood strategies and economic constraints. While many of the reviewed studies evaluate local knowledge as holding great promise for biodiversity conservation, the conclusions regarding practical implications of including this knowledge into forest and conservation management are mixed. In particular, the interaction of traditional conservation paradigms rooted in local ecological knowledge and science-based modern paradigms is not thoroughly addressed. This applies especially to European countries, where research on local ecological knowledge is scattered. Drawing on these observations, we conclude that a greater focus on the ways in which societies in these countries can (re)generate, transform and apply local ecological knowledge can play a crucial role in integrating conservation objectives into forest management under changing environmental conditions.","[Joa, Bettina] Univ Freiburg, Fac Environm & Nat Resources, Tennenbacher Str 4, D-79106 Freiburg, Germany; [Winkel, Georg] EFI, Pl Vereinten Nationen 7, D-53133 Bonn, Germany; [Primmer, Eeva] Finnish Environm Inst SYKE, POB 140, Helsinki 00251, Finland",bettinajoa@confobi.uni-freiburg.de; georg.winkel@efi.int; eeva.primmer@ymparisto.fi,75,34,33,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0264-8377,LAND USE POLICY,Land Use Pol.,2018,Green Submitted,

The consideration of historical and philosophical contexts that affect tribal communities may be beneficial in such cases. I provide a historical context by presenting chronological events of Indian Country in the United States as related to Federal Indian Law in parallel with the development of wildlife management as a profession. Additionally, I explore the philosophical context of TEK as science by discussing Western and Indigenous scientific paradigms and their linkages to TEK. Finally, given these contexts, I provide several suggestions for developing culturally sensitive approaches to TEK research in the wildlife field.

In this paper, we propose a technique to ordinate and plot combined values-choices of individuals in a 4 phase/2D plane regarding the implementation of ecological modernization policies organized around four traits, i.e., speed and quantity of the process, organizational complexity and governance origin of a project. Results are intriguing. Arrangements of combined individual choices appear with a main sequence corresponding to the fatalist anthropological rationality category according to Douglas' model of polyrationalities. There are differences between public quantitative and qualitative evaluations of specific projects; these differences are maximized when conservation plans are confronted to specific energy facilities. We propose the idea that this technique could be an instrument for scrutinizing public engagement with- and appreciation of-biodiversity conservation in the emerging field of culturomics.","[Troumbis, Andreas Y.] Univ Aegean, Dept Environm, Biodivers Conservat Lab, Sch Environm, Mitilini, Greece; [Hatziantoniou, Maria N.] Univ Aegean, Dept Environm, Sect Environm Social Sci, Sch Environm, Mitilini, Greece",atro@aegean.gr; mhatz@aegean.gr,71,4,4,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0960-3115,BIODIVERS CONSERV,Biodivers.

Yet, limited empirical evidence for this claim exists, especially on the African continent where community-based conservancies (CBCs) are being rapidly adopted in diverse institutional forms across multiple countries. We provide the first large-scale systematic review of CBC outcomes in sub-Saharan Africa. We review the literature on CBCs and develop a conceptual model that illustrates the nested scales of interaction in which CBCs are embedded, the institutional processes (conditions) reported as important for success, and the outcomes of CBCs on social and ecological systems. The mixed-method approach consists of inductive/deductive textual analysis of cases, geospatial visualization, descriptive statistics, and correlational analysis. Results indicate that more often than not, establishment of CBCs in Africa has led to negative or a mixture of positive and negative social outcomes, whereas ecological outcomes have been largely positive. The research conducted on CBC institutions has overwhelmingly focused on social outcomes, using qualitative methods. Monetary and nonmonetary incentives seem to be important but not sufficient on their own for positive outcomes. Devolution of rights to the local community is significantly associated with CBC outcomes but was not present in many cases, despite this feature being a hallmark of CBCs. A number of conditions were not reported in the cases reviewed, including leadership, social learning, consideration of cultural worldviews, and diverse partnerships. We provide indepth examples of the types and diversity of outcomes and contexts underpinning the presence or absence of societal processes, highlight important gaps in the existing research, and offer guidelines for research and evaluation moving forward.","[Galvin, Kathleen A.] Colorado State Univ, Dept Anthropol, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Beeton, Tyler A.] North Cent Climate Adaptat Sci Ctr, Reston, VA USA; [Beeton, Tyler A.; Luizza, Matthew W.] Colorado State Univ, Nat Resource Ecol Lab, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA",,96,40,41,RESILIENCE ALLIANCE,WOLFVILLE,"ACADIA UNIV, BIOLOGY DEPT, WOLFVILLE, NS B0P 1X0, CANADA",1708-3087,ECOL SOC,Ecol.

Participatory mapping and semi structured interviews were conducted with 52 stakeholders and 22 managers and scientists to identify ecological priorities and concerns across a large temperate MPA in Port Stephens-Great Lakes Marine Park, Australia. There were 19 iconic species of fish, dolphins, whales, and sea turtles that were the focus of ecological priorities and stakeholder interactions with the marine environment. Effectiveness of the current MPA management plan for addressing stakeholder priority and concerns, was assessed using GIS spatial modelling that created fuzzy-set species distribution models (SDMs) based on Traditional and Local Ecological Knowledge as well as scientific and citizen-science survey data. These spatial models for the iconic species across the MPA were then overlaid with ecological concerns of the stakeholders to create a spatial understanding of local threats, and priority areas for targeted management. Poor water quality from terrestrial primary sources was the main concern of stakeholders, more so than in-water threats such as poor fishing practices or impacts to iconic species. While local managers and scientists were relatively reluctant to answer interview questions, there was a general misalignment in approaches to iconic species management, especially for mobile and migratory species, and misunderstanding of stakeholder perceptions of threats. Participatory mapping of social-ecological values provides a method for stakeholders and decision-makers to better understand, discuss, and adapt marine spatial management approaches that support a diversity of conservation and management priorities.","[Noble, Mae M.; Doran, Bruce] Australian Natl Univ, Fenner Sch Environm & Soc, 141 Linneaus Way, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia; [Harasti, David] NSW Dept Primary Ind, Fisheries Res, Locked Bag 1, Taylors Beach, NSW 2315, Australia; [Fulton, Christopher J.] Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Biol, 46 Sullivans Creek Rd, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia",mae.noble@anu.edu.au,135,5,5,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0006-3207,BIOL CONSERV,Biol.

We focused on the relationship between fishers and non-human entities (e.g., animals, tides, lunar cycles, etc.) from alternative conservation paradigms according to Palsson's schema (orientalism, paternalism, communalism). We also explored the ecological knowledge of fisher communities to identify possible conservation strategies. Using an ethnographic approach, we identified communalism as the dominant paradigm within the fisher communities as opposed to the paternalistic and orientalist approaches of conservationists and industry employees in the BBE. Fishers demonstrated a broad knowledge on the effects of climate change on fish stocks and pollution on ocean environments and biota, which gillnets avoid catching juveniles and threatened species, and landscape changes over the long-term period, among others areas that could be useful for conservation of these changing coastal ecosystems.

However, such advances are often decoupled from conservation practice, impeding translation of scientific understanding into effective conservation and of conservation-motivated research into wider conceptual understanding. We summarise key outcomes from long-term studies of a red-billed chough Pyrrhocorax pyrrhocorax population of conservation concern, where we proactively aimed to achieve the dual and interacting objectives of advancing population and evolutionary ecology and advancing effective conservation. Estimation of means, variances and covariances in key vital rates from individual-based demographic data identified temporal and spatial variation in subadult survival as key constraints on lambda, and simultaneously provided new insights into how vital rates can vary as functions of demographic structure, natal conditions and parental life history. Targeted analyses showed that first-year survival increased with prey abundance, implying that food limitation may constrain lambda. First-year survival then decreased dramatically, threatening population viability and prompting emergency supplementary feeding interventions. Detailed evaluations suggested that the interventions successfully increased first-year survival in some years and additionally increased adult survival and successful reproduction, thereby feeding back to inform intervention refinements and understanding of complex ecological constraints on lambda. Genetic analyses revealed novel evidence of expression of a lethal recessive allele, and demonstrated how critically small effective population size can arise, thereby increasing inbreeding and loss of genetic variation. Population viability analyses parameterised with all available demographic and genetic data showed how ecological and genetic constraints can interact to limit population viability, and identified ecological management as of primacy over genetic management to ensure short-term persistence of the focal population. This case study demonstrates a full iteration through the sequence of primary science, evidence-based intervention, quantitative evaluation and feedback that is advocated in conservation science but still infrequently achieved. It thereby illustrates how pure science advances informed conservation actions to ensure the (short-term) stability of the target population, and how conservation-motivated analyses fed back to advance fundamental understanding of population processes.","[Reid, Jane M.; Fenn, Sarah R.] Univ Aberdeen, Sch Biol Sci, Zool Bldg, Aberdeen, Scotland; [Reid, Jane M.] NTNU, Inst Biol, Ctr Biodivers Dynam, Trondheim, Norway; [Bignal, Eric; Bignal, Sue] Scottish Chough Study Grp, Isle Of Islay, Argyll, Scotland; [McCracken, Davy, I] Scotlands Rural Coll, Dept Integrated Land Management, Ayr, Scotland; [Trask, Amanda E.] Zool Soc London, Inst Zool, London, England; [Monaghan, Pat] Univ Glasgow, Inst Biodivers Anim Hlth & Comparat Med, Graham Kerr Bldg, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland",jane.reid@abdn.ac.uk,73,0,0,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8790,J ANIM ECOL,J.

Previous studies have even defined these forests as subjected to an empty forest syndrome, a condition in which forests that are apparently well preserved are instead almost deprived of vertebrate faunas due to extreme exploitation by local communities. Forest specialists, including several primates, are among the most threatened species in the country. The Laotian langur (Trachypithecus laotum) is endemic to Lao PDR, is listed as Endangered by the IUCN Red List, and it is one of the least studied species in the region. A survey on the local distribution, life history and conservation status of the Laotian langur was carried out in Phou Hin Poun National Protected Area, Khammouane Province of Lao PDR. The survey consisted of an initial phase with interviews to select key informants on the Laotian langur and the other primate species of the area. Then, a phase of field surveys along forest transects, totaling 64.1 km of 21 transects, yielded a record of 35 individuals in 9 groups. The highest encounter/detection rate of the Laotian langur was 1 group per km at one sector of the park. In contrast, it was much lower (0.18-0.34 groups/km) in the rest of the protected area. The group sizes were much lower than those observed in the same area between 1994 and 2010, thus suggesting a decline in the population size of langurs. This decline may be linked to habitat loss (timber extraction and mining). Still, also overhunting, as signs of poaching were observed during our field surveys. This was also supported by the reports of our interviewees. Laotian langurs were observed to be sympatric and interact while foraging with the Assamese macaque (Macaca assamensis). In the cases of sympatric occurrence between the two species, we observed that subtle mechanisms of niche partitioning may occur to reduce interspecific competition for food. Further research on the population and ecology of this endangered langur should be conducted to understand the species and aid its conservation.","[Souwideth, Johnny; Thanh, Hai Dong] Vietnam Natl Univ Forestry, St 21, Hanoi 100000, Vietnam; [Brakels, Peter] IUCN Vientiane Off, 391-24 Bourichane Rd, Viangchan, Laos; [Van, Thong Pham] Save Vietnams Wildlife, Cuc Phuong Natl Pk, Cuc Phuong Commune 430000, Nho Quan, Vietnam; [Luiselli, Luca] Inst Dev Ecol Conservat & Cooperat, Via G Tomasi Lampedusa 33, I-00144 Rome, Italy; [Luiselli, Luca] Rivers State Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Appl & Environm Biol, PMB 5080, Port Harcourt, Nigeria; [Luiselli, Luca] Univ Lome, Fac Sci, Dept Zool & Biol Anim, BP 1515, Lome, Togo",johnnyblack1991@gmail.com; p.phiapalath@gmail.com; donghaifuv@gmail.com; peter.brakels@iucn.org; thong@svw.vn; l.luiselli@ideccngo.org,43,0,0,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,DIVERSITY-BASEL,Diversity-Basel,2021,gold,

Here we investigate the feeding ecology of G. blacki in its core habitat (Guangxi, Southern China) during the early Early Pleistocene, which was the early period in its evolution. Materials and methods: The stable isotopic (C, O) analysis of tooth enamel of the fauna associated with G. blacki (n = 58), including the largest number of G. blacki teeth (n = 12) to date from the Liucheng Gigantopithecus Cave (similar to 2 Ma), Guangxi, China, is undertaken. Results: The delta C-13 values of Liucheng fauna range from -12.9 to -19.0 parts per thousand with an average of -16.1 +/- 1.3 parts per thousand (n = 58) and the delta O-18 values range from -4.3 to -9.6 parts per thousand with an average of -6.9 +/- 1.2 parts per thousand (n = 58). The delta C-13 values of G. blacki range from -15.9 parts per thousand to -17.0 parts per thousand with an average of -16.5 +/- 0.4 parts per thousand (n = 12), and the delta O-18 values vary from -5.9 parts per thousand to -7.5 parts per thousand with an average of -6.6 +/- 0.5 parts per thousand (n = 12). Conclusions: The isotopic data show Guangxi was characterized by closed C-3 forest and humid climate in the early Early Pleistocene. Niche partitioning is found among G. blacki, Sinomastodon, Ailuropoda and Stegodon, the typical megafauna in South China in the early Early Pleistocene. This could be one of the important factors for them to co-exist until the Middle Pleistocene. Smallest isotopic variations of G. blacki are found compared with those of contemporary animals, indicating a conservative foraging ecology i.e., limited foraging area and/or narrow dietary flexibility. Furthermore, the more confined foraging ecology of G. blacki is also seen in comparison with fossil and extant large-bodied primates. However, the unique dietary pattern of G. blacki does not seem to have hindered its survival. The environment in Guangxi during the early Early Pleistocene offered the suitable conditions for G. blacki to become one of the typical species in the faunal assemblages.","[Jiang, Quyi; Zhao, Lingxia; Guo, Lin; Hu, Yaowu] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Vertebrate Paleontol & Paleoanthropol, Key Lab Vertebrate Evolut & Human Origins, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Jiang, Quyi; Hu, Yaowu] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Dept Archeol & Anthropol, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Jiang, Quyi] Zhejiang Prov Off Cultural Relics Authenticat, Hangzhou, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Lingxia; Guo, Lin] CAS Ctr Excellence Life & Paleoenvironm, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Guo, Lin] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Coll Earth & Planetary Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Hu, Yaowu] Fudan Univ, Dept Cultural Heritage & Museol, 220 Handan Rd, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China; [Hu, Yaowu] Fudan Univ, Inst Archaeol Sci, Shanghai, Peoples R China",zhaolingxia@ivpp.ac.cn; ywhu@fudan.edu.cn,119,0,0,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9483,AM J PHYS ANTHROPOL,Am.

However, protecting vulnerable populations requires establishing threat criteria at sub-global scales, e.g., national Red Lists. In data-poor contexts, typical of many developing countries, assessing threat status by applying IUCN criteria constitutes a major challenge, which may be one reason for mismatches between national and global Red List assessments. Despite the intense harvesting of threatened elasmobranchs species in Brazilian waters, Brazilian fisheries monitoring has ceased to exist for nearly a decade. This jeopardizes accurate assessment of species' conservation status at a local scale. In the absence of fisheries records, local ecological knowledge (LEK) provides an alternative option to obtain reliable information on targeted species. We interviewed 186 fishers from four Brazilian Northeastern states, whose recollections spanned six decades and documented catches or sightings of 19 shark species. For eight species with sufficient data, temporal trends in maximum length of sharks caught by fishers of different age-classes were statistically tested. Four species' maximum length declined over time, while four were primarily captured by elderly fishers, with few or no recent catches reported. Of these species, one is classified more conservatively in the national Red List vs. IUCN Red List, which is supported by LEK results. Contrastingly, two species are classified less conservatively at the national level than by IUCN, such that upgrading and matching IUCN's conservation criteria is warranted.

However, how these two aspects of influencing factors jointly drive the dynamics of sediment retention service is still poorly understood, although it is critical to evaluate ecosystem service dynamics and realize the balanced relationships between human activities and aquatic ecosystem health. Integrating the revised universal soil loss equation (RUSLE) model and sediment delivery ratio (SDR) model, this study evaluated dynamics of sediment retention service driven by combined factors of socio-economic development and ecological conservation policies. Furthermore, the relative contribution analysis identified contributions of these drivers to sediment dynamics. Results indicated that (1) sediment retention service improved from 2000 to 2015 in the Qiantang River Basin, with a 39.89% reduction in sediment export. (2) Ecological conservation policies played a more critical role in this improvement than socio-economic development. (3) In particular, the Green Project made the major contribution to controlling sediment export among all the drivers, additionally, increasing grain yield (per unit area) benefited sediment retention service because it mitigated the substantial demand for farmland and the excessive deprivation of ecological lands. (4) The emerging Ecological Conservation Red Line (ECRL) policy could reduce sediment export inside the redline regions by 84.13% through future scenario analysis, providing practical guidance for exploring more ecological benefits. Finally, suggestions for formulating targeted ecological protection policies and sustainable socio-economic plans were proposed to promote aquatic ecosystem services and strengthen ecological security in the large basin.

In this respect, the incorporation of spatial constraints, fragmentation and connectivity indices into optimization procedures is an important challenge for improving decision support. Here we present a novel optimization approach developed to accurately represent a broad range of conservation planning questions with spatial constraints and landscape indices. Relying on constraint programming, a technique from artificial intelligence based on automatic reasoning, this approach provides both constraint satisfaction and optimality guarantees. We applied this approach in a real case study to support managers of the 'Cote Oubliee - 'Woen Vuu - Pwa Pereeu' provincial park project, in the biodiversity hotspot of New Caledonia. Under budget, accessibility and equitable allocation constraints, we identified restorable areas optimal for reducing forest fragmentation and improving inter-patch structural connectivity, respectively measured with the effective mesh size and the integral index of connectivity. Synthesis and applications. Our work contributes to more effective and policy-relevant conservation planning by providing a spatially explicit and problem-focused optimization approach. By allowing an exact representation of spatial constraints and landscape indices, it can address new questions and ensure whether the solutions will be socio-economically feasible, through optimality and satisfiability guarantees. Our approach is generic and flexible, thus applicable to a wide range of conservation planning problems, such as ecological restoration planning, reserve or corridor design.","[Justeau-Allaire, Dimitri; Vieilledent, Ghislain; Birnbaum, Philippe] UMR AMAP, CIRAD, Montpellier, France; [Justeau-Allaire, Dimitri; Birnbaum, Philippe] Inst Agron Neocaledonien IAC, Noumea, New Caledonia; [Justeau-Allaire, Dimitri; Vieilledent, Ghislain; Birnbaum, Philippe] Univ Montpellier, CNRS, INRAE, AMAP,CIRAD,IRD, Montpellier, France; [Rinck, Nicolas] DDDT, Noumea, Province Sud, New Caledonia; [Vismara, Philippe] Univ Montpellier, Montpellier SupAgro, INRAE, MISTEA, Montpellier, France; [Vismara, Philippe] Univ Montpellier, CNRS, LIRMM, Montpellier, France; [Lorca, Xavier] IMT Mines Albi, Ctr Genie Ind, Albi, France",dimitri.justeau@gmail.com,57,2,2,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8901,J APPL ECOL,J.

Conservation science and adaptive ecosystem management demand more rapid, quantitative, and non-invasive technologies for robustly capturing changing biodiversity and quantifying species interactions. Here we develop molecular ecological network analyses (MENA) as an ecosystem assessment tool to address these needs. To construct the ecological network, we used environmental DNA from feces to identify the plant and mammal diet of two carnivores: puma (Puma concolor) and bobcat (Lynx rufus); two omnivores: coyote (Canis latrans) and gray fox (Urocyon cinereoargenteus); and two herbivores: black-tailed deer (Odocoileus hemionus) and black-tailed jackrabbit (Lepus californicus) in a well-studied Californian reserve. To evaluate MENA as a comprehensive biodiversity tool, we applied our framework to identify the structure of the network, patterns of trophic interactions, key species, and to assess its utility in capturing the biodiversity of the area. The high dietary taxonomic resolution enabled the assessment of species diversity, niche breadth and overlap. The network analysis revealed a dense ecological network with a high diversity of weakly connected species and a community that is highly modular and non-nested. The significant prevalence of tri-trophic chain and exploitative competition patterns indicates (i) the removal or reintroduction of a top predator would trigger a trophic cascade within this community, directly affecting their prey and indirectly the plant communities, and (ii) the potential impact of indirect effects between two predators that consume the same prey. These results suggest that the recent resurgence of puma in the study area may impact the herbaceous and woody vegetation and the population size of other predators. This effect of fluctuating predator populations and plant communities could be predicted through MENA's fine-scale assessment of the diet selection and the identified keystone species. Although just using a subset of species, MENA more rapidly, accurately, and effectively captured the broader biodiversity of the area in comparison to other methodologies. MENA reconstructed and unveiled the hidden complexity in trophic structure and interaction networks within the community, providing a promising toolkit for biodiversity and ecosystem management.","[Meyer, Jordana M.; Leempoel, Kevin; Losapio, Gianalberto; Hadly, Elizabeth A.] Stanford Univ, Dept Biol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Hadly, Elizabeth A.] Stanford Univ, Jasper Ridge Biol Preserve, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Hadly, Elizabeth A.] Stanford Univ, Stanford Woods Inst Environm, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",jordana7@stanford.edu,135,4,4,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",2296-701X,FRONT ECOL EVOL,Front.

However, the distribution characteristics of soil and water conservation measures (SWCMs) under ecological restoration projects and the water storage and soil conservation benefits from a macro perspective are not yet clear. To solve this problem, first of all, the red soil hilly region (RSHR) of China has been chosen to analyze the 30-year process and spatial trends of SWCMs in ecological restoration projects. The spatial distribution of SWCMs is analyzed from the three-dimensional plane of level and elevation. In addition, four benefit characteristics of SWCMs have been obtained by comparing the amount of water and soil protected and the intensity of soil erosion. Finally, the paper explores methods that improve the efficiency of SWC in key areas. The research results show that the paradigm of SWC changes from comprehensive management to ecological rules and the goal of SWCMs has shifted from initial farmland maintenance to natural forest restoration, and the average soil erosion has not only decreased by 291 t/(km(2).a) as a whole but has also reflected the transformation from agriculture to ecology in the national ecological restoration project strategy. The distribution model of SWCMs on the horizontal plane is a convex second-order function. In the vertical direction, the proportion of measures distributed in hilly areas was 38%, higher than that in plain and mountain areas. Moreover, SWCMs are concentrated in cultivated land and forest land, among which the proportion of terraces, SWC forests and grass planting measures is as high as 35% in areas with high erosion. For the RSHR in the four SWC benefits of group characteristics and the distribution ratio, respectively: SWC ability and soil erosion intensity are lower (group 1, 9%). There is a lower amount of soil and water storage and higher intensity of soil erosion (group 2, 19%). The amount of soil and water storage is large, and the intensity of soil erosion is low (group 3, 27%). Soil and water storage and soil erosion intensity are both high (group 4,13%). In a word, it is necessary to improve the proportion of SWC forest construction in river basins and intensive agricultural cultivation areas in national key SWC areas to enhance ecosystem service functions. This paper analyzes the pattern changes and benefit characteristics of SWCMs from a macro perspective, which provides a new perspective for the large-scale study of SWC in the future. This result in preventing soil erosion aims to make China's ecological civilization construction and ecological management more sustainable. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

In addition to occurrences of species and habitats inside protected area candidate sites, one may also be interested about network-level connectivity considerations. Objectives We applied SCP to the identification of ecological networks to inform the development of a new regional plan for the region of Uusimaa (South-Finland, including the Finnish capital district). Methods Input data were 59 high-quality layers of biotope and species distribution data. We identified ecological networks based on a combination of a Zonation balanced priority ranking map and a weighted range size rarity map, to account for both relative and absolute conservation values in the process. We also identified ecological corridors between protected areas and other ecologically high-priority areas using the corridor retention method of Zonation. Furthermore, we identified candidate sites for habitat restoration. Results We found seven large ecological networks (132-1201 km(2)) which stand out from their surrounding landscape in terms of ecological value and have clear connectivity bottlenecks between them. Highest restoration needs were found between large high-priority sites that are connected via remnant habitat fragments in comparatively highly modified areas. Conclusions Land conversion should be avoided in areas of highest ecological priorities and network-level connectivity. Restoration should be considered for connectivity bottlenecks. Methods described here can be applied in any location where relevant spatial data are available.

Typically created through Geographical Information Systems and modelling processes at regional and even continental scales, these projects are seldom evaluated or 'ground-truthed' for their potential application at the local level where land use is fully allocated and replete with human occupation. This article reviews the accuracy of one such continental-scale connectivity conservation network, the National Green Network, through assessment and redesign by a design charrette at the local scale in York, Western Australia. Breaking with traditional process, this research considered the National Green Network model not as a final plan, but as point of departure for an iterative adjustment and redesign process through the charrette and an additional detailed design stage. Commonplace in architecture and urban planning disciplines, the application of charrettes to connectivity conservation design offers the benefits of improving design accuracy and enhancing their potential for implementation through providing valuable feedback and iterative design adjustment. The fine-tuning conducted by this research enabled the design to factor in human land-uses and influences across complex landscapes, while considering in a critical manner cultural factors that could also influence the system's design and its success. The framing of the network as green infrastructure rather than as connectivity conservation in addition to further illustration by the landscape architect provided a spectrum of both ecological and cultural outcomes across the case study landscape, demonstrating potential impacts and opportunities offered through a series of spatially accurate and ground-truthed plans.","[Kilbane, Simon] Univ Technol Sydney, Fac Design Architecture & Bldg, Broadway, NSW, Australia; [Weller, Richard] Univ Penn, Sch Design, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Hobbs, Richard] Univ Western Australia, Sch Plant Biol, Nedlands, WA, Australia",simon.kilbane@uts.edu.au; rjweller@design.upenn.edu; richard.hobbs@uwa.edu.au,87,2,2,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0169-2046,LANDSCAPE URBAN PLAN,Landsc.

Environmental compensation is considered a tool to reduce socio-environmental conflict, improve the equity of conservation and promote sustainable development. The intricacies of specific socio-ecological systems may determine how compensation payments are interpreted locally to produce outcomes. This research examines the social perceptions of an ecological fiscal transfer which intends to compensate the local public administration for the substantial costs of conservation in a hotspot of biological and social diversity in the Brazilian Atlantic forest. In this context we explore whether financial compensation (1) influences local perceptions of the conservation regime, (2) contributes towards the reconciliation of human-conservation conflicts and (3) triggers any meaningful socio-economic improvement that would counter the local costs of conservation. Results show that environmental compensation is not widely recognised as effectively benefiting the community. Local authorities consider compensation insufficient to enact a sustainable development agenda. Environmental compensation could play an important role in a policy mix for socially equitable conservation by being explicitly linked to community benefits, especially to fostering local livelihoods. The collaboration of actors operating across multiple governance levels may improve the institutional capacity of local actors to produce effective outcomes.","[Selva, Gracie Verde; Pauli, Natasha; Clifton, Julian] Univ Western Australia, UWA Sch Agr & Environm, 35 Stirling Highway, Perth, WA, Australia; [Kim, Milena Kiatkoski] Univ Western Australia, Ctr Environm Econ & Policy, Perth, WA, Australia",gracie.verdeselva@research.uwa.edu.au,68,5,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-9839,LOCAL ENVIRON,Local Environ.,2019,,

Foundation species-dependent organisms have been studied at the expense of the habitat-forming species that build and maintain communities. We used cobble beaches as a model system to discuss the consequences of this disparity on translational ecology. We suggest that the historic development of ecology has led to an academic discipline ill-suited for proactive conservation.

For example, physiology is one of several key determinants of an organism's ecological niche (along with evolutionary constraints and ecological interactions). The fundamental role of physiology in niche determination led to the development of the field of physiological ecology. This approach considers physiological mechanisms in the context of the environment to understand mechanistic variations that beget ecological trends. Physiological ecology, as an integrative discipline, has recently experienced a resurgence with respect to conservation applications, largely in conjunction with technological advances that extended physiological work from the lab into the natural world. This is of critical importance for species such as elasmobranchs (sharks, skates and rays), which are an especially understudied and threatened group of vertebrates. In 2017, at the American Elasmobranch Society meeting in Austin, Texas, the symposium entitled 'Applications of Physiological Ecology in Elasmobranch Research' provided a platform for researchers to showcase work in which ecological questions were examined through a physiological lens. Here, we highlight the research presented at this symposium, which emphasized the strength of linking physiological tools with ecological questions. We also demonstrate the applicability of using physiological ecology research as a method to approach conservation issues, and advocate for a more available framework whereby results are more easily accessible for their implementation into management practices.","[Lyons, K.] Georgia Aquarium, 225 Baker St NW, Atlanta, GA 30313 USA; [Bigman, J.

In this context, the key ecological attributes (KEA) have been introduced as aspects of a conservation target's biology or ecology that, if missing or altered, would lead to the loss of that target over time. Ecological stresses describe the impaired status of KEAs. Whilst for threats, the drivers of stresses, a systematic classification has been suggested and adopted by IUCN, all existing proposals for stresses and KEAs are preliminary. In order to fill the gap and provide conservation analysts and practitioners with a standard terminology supporting adaptive management planning we suggest a first hierarchical framework and comprehensive classification of key ecological attributes and corresponding stresses to biodiversity. Analyzing 22 vulnerability assessments in 13 countries, spread across 5 continents, as well as an extensive literature review, we identified 144 specific KEAs and stresses. These are differentiated and classified according to three hierarchical levels, 11 KEA and stress classes and 42 general KEAs and stresses. Our classification may help with describing and understanding both the natural functionality and also impaired functioning of biodiversity targets, as well as assist with the development of appropriate conservation strategies. The classification of key ecological attributes is presented as a list but it is important to recognize that the diverse array of KEAs and stresses are systemically interrelated across scales.","[Schick, Axel; Ibisch, Pierre L.] Eberswalde Univ Sustainable Dev, Ctr Econ & Ecosyst Management, Fac Forest & Environm, Alfred Moeller Str 1, D-16225 Eberswalde, Germany; [Porembski, Stefan] Univ Rostock, Inst Biowissensch Allgemeine & Spezielle Bot Gart, Fac Math & Nat Sci, Wismarsche Str 8, D-18051 Rostock, Germany; [Hobson, Peter R.] Writtle Sch Sustainable Environm, Ctr Econ & Ecosyst Management, Chelmsford CM1 3RR, Essex, England",axel.schick@hnee.de,84,6,6,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1476-945X,ECOL COMPLEX,Ecol.

These animals are vital to subsistence economies and cultures, so including the needs of both animals and hunters in conservation planning is key to sustaining social-ecological systems. In the northeast Chukchi Sea, a nearshore corridor of open water is a major spring migration route for half a million eider ducks that are hunted along the landfast ice. Zoning areas for industrial activities or conservation should consider both eider habitat and hunter access to those habitats from the variable ice edge. Based on benthic sampling in 2010-2012, a model of eider foraging energetics and satellite data on ice patterns in April and May 1997-2011, we mapped the range of positions of the landfast ice edge relative to a given dispersion of habitat suitable for eider feeding. In some sectors, feeding areas were too limited or too far from landfast ice to provide regular hunting access. In other sectors, overlap of the ice edge with eider feeding habitat was quite variable, but often within a consistent geographic range. Areas accessible to hunters were a small fraction of total eider habitat, so areas adequate for conserving eiders would not necessarily include areas that meet the hunters' needs. These results can inform spatial planning of industrial activities that yield cash income critical to subsistence hunting in less developed locations. Our study provides an approach for mapping subsistence conservation areas' throughout the Arctic and an example for such efforts elsewhere.","[Lovvorn, James R.; Rocha, Aariel R.] Southern Illinois Univ, Dept Zool, 1125 Lincoln Dr, Carbondale, IL 62901 USA; [Lovvorn, James R.; Rocha, Aariel R.] Southern Illinois Univ, Ctr Ecol, 1125 Lincoln Dr, Carbondale, IL 62901 USA; [Mahoney, Andrew H.] Univ Alaska Fairbanks, Geophys Inst, Fairbanks, AK 99775 USA; [Jewett, Stephen C.] Univ Alaska Fairbanks, Inst Marine Sci, Fairbanks, AK 99775 USA",lovvorn@siu.edu,45,3,3,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0376-8929,ENVIRON CONSERV,Environ.

We investigated temporal trends in collaboration in the tropical ecology and conservation literature by examining patterns of authorship for 2271 articles published from 2000 to 2016 in Biotropica and the Journal of Tropical Ecology. Consistent with trends in other studies and scientific disciplines, we found that the number of authors per article increased from 2.6 in 2000 to 4.2 in 2015 using a generalized linear model (glm). We modeled changes in multinational collaboration in articles using a glm and found that the mean number of author-affiliated countries increased from 1.3 (+/- 0.6 SD) to 1.7 (+/- 0.8 SD) over time and that increases were best explained by the number of authors per article. The proportion of authors based in tropical countries increased, but the probability of tropical-extratropical collaboration did not and was best explained solely by the number of authors per article. Overall, our analyses suggest that only certain types of collaboration are increasing and that these increases coincide with a general increase in the number of authors per article. Such changes in author numbers and collaboration could be the result of increased data sharing, changes in the scope of research questions, changes in authorship criteria, or scientific migration. We encourage tropical conservation scientists continue to build collaborative ties, particularly with researchers based in underrepresented tropical countries, to ensure that tropical ecology and conservation remains inclusive and effective.","[Perez, Timothy M.] Univ Miami, Dept Biol, Coral Gables, FL 33146 USA; [Perez, Timothy M.] Fairchild Trop Bot Garden, Coral Gables, FL 33156 USA; [Hogan, J.

We monitored and assessed its effectiveness and analysed the factors that may contribute to the success or failure of the program. By comparing ecosystem changes between project and non-project regions, we found that the increased area of grassland and wetland, the proportion of restored grassland, and the enhanced net primary production and forage yields were higher in project regions, which indicated that the majority of restoration measures are effective at the local scale. However, the soil erosion modulus and ecosystem soil conservation service were ineffective owing to unrecovered root systems and increased precipitation. The results of interviews with herdsmen demonstrated a slight increase in annual net income for herder households, especially for eco-immigrants compensated by the program. However, it was difficult to reduce overgrazing dramatically because eco-immigrants mainly included elderly herders and herders with less livestock. Therefore, the eco-immigrants and their livelihoods need to be reconsidered in targeting for subsequent programs.

While the challenge of setting quantitative representation targets has been well addressed in the literature, guidelines for conceptualising and setting process targets are lacking. Process targets can be defined as the minimum amount of natural habitat that must remain to ensure the long-term survival of the majority of species. While a representation target may represent the majority of species in a landscape, this target often falls far short of conserving processes necessary for the persistence of these species. This paper explores the potential for landscape ecology research to provide useful insights into developing process targets by relating critical thresholds in habitat amount to the probability of population persistence. It is proposed that these thresholds provide a basis for developing generic top-down ecological process targets in conservation planning. The percolation threshold, theoretically defined at 59%, is increasingly used to inform research into ecological state shifts and ecosystem resilience. This threshold may provide a basis for developing top-down process targets in instances where comprehensive bottom-up spatial data on individual ecological processes is unavailable. In the context of ongoing global habitat loss, this approach provides a pragmatic, but also potentially biologically meaningful, way of incorporating defensible and quantitative ecological process targets or biodiversity persistence goals into conservation plans.","[Desmet, Philip G.] Nelson Mandela Univ, Dept Zool, Inst Coastal & Marine Res, POB 77000, ZA-6031 Port Elizabeth, South Africa",drphil@ecosolgis.com,38,14,15,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0006-3207,BIOL CONSERV,Biol.

Objectives We sought to determine how the potential for land use conflict-a social construct-was related (or not) to ecological systems of landscapes. Methods Using participatory mapping data from a regional case study in Australia, we identified the potential for land use conflict using a model that combines spatially-explicit place values with preferences for specific land uses related to development and conservation. Multiple proxies of biodiversity were used to evaluate the landscape's ecological systems at ecosystems and species levels. Range maps were used to identify areas of high species diversity value using the conservation planning software Zonation. Results We spatially intersected conflict areas with landscape attributes and found the potential for conflict over conservation to be higher in coastal areas than inland areas, more likely to be located in areas with moderate vegetation cover, more concentrated in ecosystems classified as 'No Concern' with moderate to high native vegetation. Potential conflict over conservation was disproportionately higher in areas with higher species diversity derived from conservation modelling. Conclusions The social-ecological associations in conflict analysis can inform impact assessment of land use plans on biodiversity, assist development of effective approaches to reconcile conservation and other land uses, support conservation planning by identifying priorities for conflict negotiation and understanding underlying factors for conflict.","[Karimi, Azadeh; Hockings, Marc] Univ Queensland, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia; [Karimi, Azadeh] Ferdowsi Univ Mashhad, Fac Nat Resources & Environm Sci, Mashhad, Iran",azadeh.karimi@uq.net.au; m.hockings@uq.edu.au,50,14,19,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-2973,LANDSCAPE ECOL,Landsc.

Two localities are provided for both species in one protected area, Allpahuyo-Mishana National Reserve and in Puerto Almendra near the city of Iquitos, northern Peru. A different type of B. altamazonica was also discovered in Allpahuyo-Mishana. It is similar to B. madeira with a reddish coloration on the dorsal parts. Another grey type was also reported living between Puno and Madre de Dios departments at higher elevations. However, all the specimens found through their range in Peru have shown colour variation which complicates species identification. New taxonomic studies are needed to confirm their status. The Peruvian salamanders appear to be semi-arboreal species living in primary unflooded terra firme rainforests near water bodies where humidity is high at lower elevations as previously reported (96-118 m a.s.l.). Despite most of the Bolitoglossa species occur in protected areas, a deadly threat was recently reported in frogs (Batrachochytridium dendrobatidis) that may cause loss of salamanders in Peru. For example during our field surveys we were unable to observe B. digitigrada. New assessments are urgently needed for the protection and conservation of Peruvian salamanders. Data on biology, ecology and environmental parameters are also lacking to really protect their microhabitats, and to establish suitable ex situ keeping and breeding programs with the difficult perspective of subsequent reintroduction.","[Hernandez, Axel] Univ Pasquale Paoli Corsica, Corte, France",hernandez.axel.1989@gmail.com,21,0,0,SARANSK FOND PODDERZKI & RAZVITIA ZAPOVEDNYH,SARANSK,"SUMMER LANE, BUILDING 4,, SARANSK, REPUBLIC OF MORDOVIA 430007, RUSSIA",2500-008X,NAT CONSERV RES,Nat.

Social network analysis (SNA) has been recognized as a valuable tool capable of integrating social and ecological network data for empirical assessments of social-ecological fit. Few studies have integrated SNA with more complex spatial models, and assessments of social-ecological fit have rarely been conducted from the perspective of fit for wildlife conservation. We examined the spatial fit of the institutional network of heterogeneous conservation actors (both governmental and nongovernmental) working to conserve the Andean bear (Tremarctos ornatus) across the Colombian Andes. Our analysis was based upon social network and qualitative data derived from 67 semi-structured interviews with Colombian conservation practitioners along with a model of Andean bear connectivity. In Colombia, the known range of the Andean bear crosses the jurisdictional boundaries of 22 different autonomous regional corporations (corporaciones autonomas regionales or CARs), the primary entities responsible for implementing conservation policy in the country. We found that 53 pairs of CARs shared habitat along their jurisdictional borders that was identified as important to Andean bear connectivity, but only 16 pairs of CARs (30% of pairwise matches) communicated with one another about Andean bear research and conservation strategies. CARs were more likely to communicate with entities of Colombia's National Natural Park Service or with nongovernmental organizations (NGOs). These other entities were often located within the social network structure as intermediaries between otherwise disconnected CARs. These actors could use such strategic positions to facilitate coordination between CARs that share habitat important for Andean bear connectivity and, in so doing, improve social-ecological fit for the conservation of this species. Indeed, during interviews, Colombian NGOs often expressed concern over the lack of coordination among the CARs and several were working to amend the situation.","[Hohbein, Rhianna R.; Nibbelink, Nathan P.; Cooper, Robert J.] Univ Georgia, Warnell Sch Forestry & Nat Resources, Athens, GA 30602 USA",,68,0,0,RESILIENCE ALLIANCE,WOLFVILLE,"ACADIA UNIV, BIOLOGY DEPT, WOLFVILLE, NS B0P 1X0, CANADA",1708-3087,ECOL SOC,Ecol.

Finding a balance between ecological conservation and socioeconomic development is a solution. However, previous studies have largely neglected the concept. Here, we proposed a framework that integrates the ecological environment and socioeconomic wellbeing via farm management and the use of ecosystem services (ES) to assess rural sustainability and explore a suitable balance and pathways from the perspective of the human dimension. Taking Yan'he Township in China's Loess Plateau as an example, a clustering analysis was performed to group farm households based on their behaviour in cropping, land rental, and off-farm work. A composite index was built to assess rural sustainability at the farm household level, while a structural equation model was performed to estimate the effect of land-use practices on rural sustainability and explore adequate farm management and policy interventions. The results show that households with different farm management and land-use strategies had divergent agricultural performance, use of ES, and environmental and wellbeing outcomes. Increasing legume cropping with conservation approaches (e.g., rotation) and extended irrigation while encouraging migrant work with ensured equal urban-rural social welfare and property rights may contribute to balancing socioeconomic development with ecological conservation. The findings indicate that both interventionist policies and independent market support are vital for individual and community capacity building and public infrastructure development to stimulate agricultural adaptation and rural transformation towards sustainability.","[Li, Qirui; Ma, Hua; Feng, Hao] Chinese Acad Sci & Minist Water Resources, Inst Water & Soil Conservat, State Key Lab Soil Eros & Dryland Farming Loess P, Yangling, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Li, Qirui; Ma, Hua; Bellingrath-Kimura, Sonoko D.] Leibniz Ctr Agr Landscape Res Zalf, Muncheberg, Germany; [Li, Qirui] Univ Bayreuth, Africa Multiple Cluster Excellence, Bayreuth, Germany; [Xu, Zhuqing] Chinese Acad Sci & Technol Dev, Minist Sci & Technol, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Feng, Hao] Northwest A&f Univ, Key Lab Agr Soil & Water Engn Arid & Semiarid Are, Minist Educ, Yangling, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Bellingrath-Kimura, Sonoko D.] Humboldt Univ, Fac Life Sci, Berlin, Germany",leolee8612@gmail.com; nercwsi@vip.sina.com,84,2,2,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1350-4509,INT J SUST DEV WORLD,Int.

Most research on biogeographic patterns in mountains has focused on tropical regions; far less is known about diversity across elevational gradients and their relative contribution to conservation in temperate mountains, particularly at high latitudes. To better understand the composition, ecology, and evolutionary history of high-latitude temperate mountain bird communities, we evaluated species richness, functional redundancy, and phylogenetic diversity across three elevation-specific habitats (upper montane, subalpine, alpine) in north temperate (9 mountains in British Columbia, Canada; 54 degrees N) and south temperate (10 mountains in Chile; 39 degrees S) regions representing distinct biogeographic origins. North temperate mountains had greater absolute species richness (77 versus 63 species), while south temperate mountains supported a greater proportion of the regional species pool (63% versus 44%). North temperate species richness increased with elevation to an ecotonal peak at treeline and then declined (subalpine = 58, alpine = 30 species), while the highest richness in south temperate mountains occurred at and above treeline (41 species). Similar species turnover patterns were observed in both systems with alpine habitats supporting the most distinct avifauna. Functional traits varied between regions with proportionally more migrants in the north, compared to more habitat specialists and cavity nesters in the south, particularly in the alpine. North temperate bird communities exhibited lower functional redundancy and higher total phylogenetic diversity, indicating a community susceptible to losing ecosystem functions and evolutionary potential. Southern communities contained greater functional redundancy and more evolutionarily isolated species, consistent with convergent evolution in challenging, high elevation habitats. Overall, in north temperate mountains, greater species richness and phylogenetic diversity, coupled with lower functional redundancy, particularly below treeline, highlights the importance of montane forests for biodiversity. In south temperate mountains, a distinct, speciose community at and above treeline, in combination with supporting a large proportion of the regional species pool, indicates a unique system with disproportionate conservation value. Onethird of birds detected in north temperate mountains are considered of national or international conservation concern, compared to 9.5% of southern mountain birds. However, only 18% of the 63 species observed in the south temperate Andes (and only 5% of alpine species) have had a conservation status assessment. With increasing climate change and habitat loss pressures across elevations, temperate mountains in the Americas have significant conservation value and appear particularly important for maintaining regional biodiversity.","[Martin, Kathy; Altamirano, Tomas A.; de Zwaan, Devin R.; Vanderpas, Anneka; Wilson, Scott] Univ British Columbia, Dept Forest & Conservat Sci, 2424 Main Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada; [Martin, Kathy; Hick, Kristina G.; Wilson, Scott] Environm & Climate Change Canada, Pacific Wildlife Res Ctr, Vancouver, BC, Canada",kathy.martin@ubc.ca,96,0,0,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",,GLOB ECOL CONSERV,Glob.

The Western Ghats are a biodiversity hotspot with the highest prevalence of endemic lizards and snakes in India, and are of significant conservation concern. Our niche modelling analysis of 22 endemic threatened squamates of conservation concern in the Western Ghats shows that the study species are majorly affected by future climate change scenarios. A decrease in climatic suitability in both RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 future climatic scenarios for the majority of the study species is seen. Hotspots of species diversity in changing climatic scenarios were also modelled based on the ecological niche models, and were seen to be concentrated in the North Central and Southern Western Ghats. The existing protected area network on the site was used as the framework for the generation of a novel conservation area network for the representation of 10% and 30% of the study species on the site, and it was seen that 10.43-52.28% novel areas outside the existing network has to be designated. These novel conservation areas provide necessary contiguity between the existing protected areas for the progression of natural processes and free dispersal of various elements. The results of this paper motivate a thorough appraisal of the protected areas and species diversity in the study region, and the establishment of novel protected areas with a multi-taxon approach to conservation.","[Srinivasulu, Aditya] Wildlife Informat & Liaison Dev WILD Soc, 12 Thiruvannamalai Nagar,Saravanampatti Kalapatti, Coimbatore 641035, Tamil Nadu, India; [Srinivasulu, Bhargavi; Srinivasulu, Chelmala] Osmania Univ, Univ Coll Sci, Dept Zool, Wildlife Biol & Taxon Lab, Hyderabad 500007, Telangana, India; [Srinivasulu, Bhargavi; Srinivasulu, Chelmala] Zoo Outreach Org, Systemat Ecol & Conservat Lab, 12 Thiruvannamalai Nagar, Coimbatore 641035, Tamil Nadu, India; [Srinivasulu, Chelmala] Osmania Univ, Ctr Biodivers & Conservat Studies, F6,CFRD Bldg, Hyderabad 500007, Telangana, India",chelmala.srinivasulu@osmania.ac.in,64,2,2,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",,GLOB ECOL CONSERV,Glob.

Most such studies have excluded the impact of pastoralists in shaping grassland ecosystems and, over the last half century, the growing human impact on the world's rangelands. The mounting human impact calls for selecting indicators and integrated monitoring methods able to track ecosystem changes and the role of natural and human agencies. Our study draws on five decades of monitoring the Amboseli landscape in southern Kenya to document the declining role of natural agencies in shaping plant ecology with rising human impact. Results We show that plant diversity and productivity have declined, biomass turnover has increased in response to a downsizing of mean plant size, and that ecological resilience has declined with the rising probability of extreme shortfalls in pasture production. The signature of rainfall and physical agencies in driving ecosystem properties has decreased sharply with growing human impact. We compare the Amboseli findings to the long-term studies of Kruger and Serengeti national parks to show that the human influence, whether by design or default, is increasingly shaping the ecology of savanna ecosystems. We look at the findings in the larger perspective of human impact on African grasslands and the world rangelands, in general, and discuss the implications for ecosystem theory and conservation policy and management. Conclusions The Amboseli study shows the value of using long-term integrated ecological monitoring to track the spatial and temporal changes in the species composition, structure, and function of rangeland ecosystems and the role of natural and human agencies in the process of change. The study echoes the widespread changes underway across African savannas and world's rangelands, concluding that some level of ecosystem management is needed to prevent land degradation and the erosion of ecological function, services, and resilience. Despite the weak application of ecological theory to conservation management, a plant trait-based approach is shown to be useful in explaining the macroecological changes underway.","[Western, David; Mose, Victor N.; Maitumo, David; Mburu, Caroline] African Conservat Ctr, POB 15289-00509, Nairobi, Kenya",vnmose@gmail.com,99,1,1,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",,ECOL PROCESS,Ecol.

We present metrics identifying distributions, site-level and global abundance, site-contextualized habitat requirements, and threats for seven dry forest endemic birds (two threatened, one Near Threatened) in the globally important Tumbes region of Peru. Extents of occurrence ranged from 36,000 to 152,000km(2), and while broad distributions were generally congruent, nearly half of species overlapped <50% of their range with other species. Population sizes ranged from the low thousands in the threatened/Near Threatened taxa to >150,000. Site-level population estimates varied hugely, reflecting size of site and extreme variation in local abundances. Large tree girths and dense low cover generally promoted bird abundance, but stem density acted in opposite directions for different species, implying the need for site- and species-specific habitat management. Habitat quality varied across sites, further complicating management options at the local level (e.g., reduced grazing). We highlight the suitability of our methods in providing useful conservation metrics for data-poor regions, and demonstrate their application.

We surveyed this species across its range in China, and interviewed 622 people in 99 villages to evaluate the relationship between gibbon status and TEK of local communities. The total confirmed population was estimated to be less than 150 individuals. Gibbon subpopulations appear to have remained stable from 2009 to 2017 both within and outside nature reserves. Sociological and environmental correlates of gibbon survival outside the reserve were: (1) more Lisu than Han people present in villages; (2) greater forest cover; (3) greater distance from county towns; (4) existence of traditional taboos on hunting gibbons; and (5) higher dependency on forest resources by villagers. Interviewees living closer to surviving gibbon populations were more knowledgeable about gibbons, although interviewees living more than 25 km away also knew more about gibbons. Formal education level was also correlated with better knowledge of gibbons, and men were better informed about gibbons than women. TEK appears to limit poaching of gibbons, thus contributing to their survival.

We analyzed phylogenetic, morphological, ecological, and acoustic data from populations in the region. We provide an updated phylogenetic hypothesis inferred from a database that contains 42 species of Gastrotheca, and sequences from mitochondrial (12S, 16S, and ND1) and nuclear (POMC and RAG-1) genes. We describe four new endemic biphasic species for Ecuador (Gastrotheca cuencana, G. elicioi, G. turnerorum, and G. yacuri). In addition, we redefine G. lojana, recently resurrected from the synonymy of G. monticola, and redescribe G. litonedis. Furthermore, we describe the tadpoles and ontogenetic color changes in six species (G. cuencana, G. elicioi, G. litonedis, G. lojana, G. pseustes, and G. turnerorum). Also, we describe the calls of seven species (G. cuencana, G. elicioi, G. litonedis, G. lojana, G. pseustes, G. testudinea, and G. yacuri). The phylogenetic relationships estimated here are congruent with previous phylogenetic hypotheses for the group, except for the placement of G. galeata, G. plumbea, G. orophylax, G. nicefori, and G. griswoldi. Because most sister species in Gastrotheca are allopatric, the evolutionarly scenarios that likely have intervened in shaping the diversity are the uplift of the Andes and the formation of cross-Andean river valleys, which probably promoted conditions that acted as dispersal barriers that led to speciation. Many species of Gastrotheca (44%) are highly threatened. Most monophasic species have not been seen since the late 1980s, whereas the highland biphasic species have survived the catastrophic events that led to the disappearance of many other sympatric anurans. Research and conservation actions are urgently needed for all surviving species treated herein, five of which are either Critically Endangered or Endangered because of their restricted distributions (10-1600 km(2)), habitat destruction and fragmentation, climate change, and pathogens. Two of the new species, G. cuencana, and G. elicioi, mostly are known from the cities of Cuenca and Loja, respectively, where urbanization threatens their survival.

The Cerrado, considered one of the global hotspots of diversity, has suffered great habitat loss due to these factors, which has been aggravated by the agricultural expansion that took place during the last 60 years. In this context, we chose species of the genus Eugenia L. (Myrtaceae) occurring in the Brazilian Cerrado to describe richness patterns and range loss, and determine conservation priorities for the Cerrado. Ecological niche models (ENMs) were applied to calculate the geographical range of each species in the past (Last Glacial Maximum - LGM, 21 000 years ago), present (PIP, representing current climatic conditions - 1760 years ago) and future (near future - NF, 2080-2100). These results were combined to calculate the richness of the group and also to estimate the range loss of these species in the future. Moreover, we evaluated the irreplaceability of areas for species conservation, aiming to maximize the biotic stability of Eugenia species. Our results showed that the highest species richness in the past was found in the southwestern region of the Cerrado and, currently, the richest regions are found in the central and southeastern areas. However, in the future, we predict a shift of the greatest values of richness towards the southeastern region, an area currently occupied by the Atlantic forest. Although areas with high conservation priorities were found scattered across the biome, this shift is worrisome due to the high fragmentation rate and intensive human occupation thoughout the Atlantic region. Thus, conservation efforts should focus on areas found within these limits.","[Oliveira, Hauanny Rodrigues] Univ Fed Goias, Programa Posgrad Genet & Biol Mol, ICB, CP 131, BR-74001970 Goiania, Go, Brazil; [Staggemeier, Vanessa G.] Sao Paulo State Univ UNESP, Inst Biosci, Dept Bot, Phenol Lab, Rio Claro, SP, Brazil; [Quintino Faria, Jair Eustaquio] Univ Brasilia, IB, Dept Bot, Brasilia, DF, Brazil; [de Oliveira, Guilherme] Univ Fed Reconcavo Bahia, Ctr Ciencias Agr Ambientais & Biol, Lab Biogeog Conservacao, Setor Biol, Cruz Das Almas, BA, Brazil; [Diniz-Filho, Jose Alexandre F.] Univ Fed Goias, ICB, Dept Ecol, Goiania, Go, Brazil",hauannyoliveira@gmail.com,66,3,3,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1442-9985,AUSTRAL ECOL,Austral Ecol.,2019,,

We developed a method to quantitatively evaluate the hydrological effect of ecological conservation programs by combining a hydrological model and mathematical method and assessed the hydrological changes attributed to ecological conservation programs (2005-2015) in the source region of the Yangtze River in China. Through improved water retention capacity, ecological conservation programs induce annual streamflow decreased by 57% and the summer flood decreased by 78%, decreasing these streamflow amounts by 60.71 m(3)center dot s(-1) and 160.14 m(3)center dot s(-1), respectively. The ecological conservation programs decreased the streamflow concentration degree in the summer-flood season, indicating reduced river flood risk. However, climate change increased annual streamflow by 167.44 m(3)center dot s(-1), which offset a large part of the decreased annual streamflow caused by the ecological conservation programs. Streamflow and streamflow concentration degree in the summer flood season increased by 366.16 m(3)center dot s(-1) and 0.27, respectively, resulting in a final increase of 206.02 m(3)center dot s(-1) in annual streamflow in the summer-flood season and an increased flood risk, offsetting some of the positive effects of ecological conservation programs.

However, traditional ecosystem services optimization methods do not take into account the complexity and uncertainty of variables. To address this complexity and uncertainty, we propose an innovative approach using a mixed-cell cellular automata (MCCA) model and a Bayesian belief network (BBN) model for ecosystem service optimization. This approach was applied to the southern region of Sichuan Province, China, using an existing dataset to simulate land use patterns and predict ecosystem services in 2035 under different development scenarios. To achieve ecological restoration and conservation, we also determined the key factor combinations and key ecological regions at various ecosystem service levels. Results showed that ecological protection scenario design has important significance as a reference for maintaining and ameliorating regional ecosystem services and functions. We also identified that the highest level of ecosystem services was mainly located in the areas with the highest net primary productivity (NPP), the highest slope, the highest forestland area, and low ET. According to these findings, some suggestions for ecological restoration and conservation in key regions were put forward. This approach fully considers the uncertainty of factors; therefore, it can be used as an effective tool for designing ecosystem management strategies.","[Zhou, Shuang] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Mt Hazards & Environm, Chengdu, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Shuang] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Coll Resources & Environm, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Peng, Li] Sichuan Normal Univ, Coll Geog & Resources, Chengdu 610101, Peoples R China",pengli@imde.ac.cn,46,0,0,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1085-3278,LAND DEGRAD DEV,Land Degrad.

The identification of priority conservation areas can preserve the value of heritage sites while promoting sustainable development, which is important for balancing the conservation and development of heritage sites. This paper proposes an integrated framework for the identification of priority conservation areas for natural heritage sites based on landscape ecological risks (LERs) and ecosystem services (ESs), taking the Bogda heritage site in Xinjiang, China as a case study. The innovative approach combined the natural and cultural elements of natural heritage sites and included the following steps: (1) the LER index, Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs (InVEST) model and questionnaire method were adopted to assess the LERs and ESs of Bogda heritage sites during 1990-2018; (2) ordered weighted averaging (OWA) was used to identify conservation priorities by weighing LERs and ESs; and (3) the optimal priority conservation area was determined by comparing the conservation efficiencies under different scenarios. The results revealed that the LER, carbon storage (CS), habitat quality (HQ), aesthetic value (AV), and recreational value (RV) showed significant spatiotemporal variation. The most suitable priority conservation area was located at the central forestlands and high-coverage grasslands, with conservation efficiencies of 1.16, 2.91, 1.96, 1.03, and 1.21 for LER, CS, HQ, AV, and RV, respectively. Our study demonstrated that integrating LERs and ESs is a comprehensive and effective approach to identifying conservation priorities for heritage sites. The results can provide decision support for the conservation of the Bogda heritage site and a methodological reference for identifying conservation priorities for natural heritage sites. Furthermore, this study is also an effective application of LERs and ESs in identifying priority conservation areas.","[Wang, Tian; Chen, Xiaodong; Lu, Yayan; Han, Fang; Yang, Zhaoping] Chinese Acad Sci, Xinjiang Inst Ecol & Geog, State Key Lab Desert & Oasis Ecol, Urumqi 830011, Peoples R China; [Wang, Tian; Chen, Xiaodong; Zheng, Xin; Lu, Yayan; Han, Fang; Yang, Zhaoping] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Zheng, Xin] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China",wangtian181@mails.ucas.ac.cn; chenxiaodong181@mails.ucas.ac.cn; zhengxin0722@igsnrr.ac.cn; luyayan16@mails.ucas.ac.cn; hanfang@ms.xjb.ac.cn; yangzp@ms.xjb.ac.cn,60,0,0,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,INT J ENV RES PUB HE,Int.

In this study, the SBM-undesirable, Moran's I, and Markov chain models are adopted to quantitatively measure and analyze the CLUE and its temporal and spatial patterns and evolution trend. The research results indicate that the CLUE in the whole study area exhibited the characteristics of one growth, two stable, and two decline stages, with a positive spatial autocorrelation that increased year by year, and a spatial spillover effect was observed. Geographical spatial patterns and spatial spillover effects played a major role in the evolution of the CLUE, and there occurred a higher probability of improvement in the vicinity of cities with high CLUE values. In the future, practical construction experience should be disseminated at the provincial level, and policies and measures should be formulated according to local conditions. In addition, a linkage model between prefecture-level cities should be developed at the municipal level to fully manifest the positive spatial spillover effect. Moreover, we should thoroughly evaluate the risk associated with CLUE transition from high to low levels and establish a low-level early warning mechanism.","[Fan, Zhenggen; Deng, Chao; Fan, Yuqi; Zhang, Puwei] Jiangxi Normal Univ, Coll City Construct, Nanchang 330022, Jiangxi, Peoples R China; [Lu, Hua] Jiangxi Univ Finance & Econ, Inst Ecol Civilizat, Nanchang 330013, Jiangxi, Peoples R China",fanzg@jxnu.edu.cn; 202040100793@jxnu.edu.cn; 005603@jxnu.edu.cn; zhang.p.w@jxnu.edu.cn; luhua@jxufe.edu.cn,61,0,0,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,INT J ENV RES PUB HE,Int.

Participatory mapping offers an opportunity to include local knowledge in spatial planning for natural resource management. However, local knowledge presents certain challenges in the form of data inconsistencies, fuzziness, and inability to disaggregate different types and formats of knowledge. Using the case of fisheries in southern Maharashtra state, India, I demonstrate how local ecological knowledge may be used to improve the understanding of data-poor fisheries. In the context of fisheries that are globally recognised as lacking management, I examine how local ecological and spatial knowledge about species and fishing practices can be used to fill fine-scale management gaps that do not account for context-specific habitat use. I also explore how fishers'spatial knowledge is intertwined with other forms of local knowledge. The participatory mapping exercise demonstrates that although fishing communities do not profess to be interested in threatened marine species conservation, their spatial and customary fishing practices potentially align with conservation goals. Clear synergies between livelihoods and marine conservation emerge when using local ecological knowledge along with participatory mapping. This research demonstrates that successful fisheries management and marine conservation planning is possible using existing social, cultural practices, translated through geographic tools.","[Karnad, Divya] Ashoka Univ, Dept Environm Studies, Sonipat 131029, Haryana, India; [Karnad, Divya] Fdn Ecol Res Advocacy & Learning, Morattandi 605101, Tamil Nadu, India",divyakarnad@hotmail.com,56,0,0,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-597X,MAR POLICY,Mar.

This paper analyses the trade-offs that have arisen as a result of this shift using social-ecological systems theory as an analytical framework. I find that, firstly, competitive funding models can weaken collaboration and knowledge exchange among landholders. Secondly, short-term funding does not allow sufficient time to establish partnerships nor to undertake adaptive management. Finally, payment for ecosystem services programmes risk crowding out the valuable volunteer ethos that arguably sustains PLC programmes over the long-term. Viewed through social-ecological systems theory, these findings suggest that a market-based approach to PLC has the potential to erode social-ecological resilience.

In this paper, a water conservation ecological spatial delimitation framework suitable for water-deficient areas was put forward. The water retention capacity of the study area in 1983, 1990, 2000, 2010, and 2016 was evaluated by using the InVEST Water Yield model and water balance method, respectively. On this basis, a flexible inflection point model based on the contribution degree of functional units was established. Then the ecological space for water conservation was delimited. The framework was applied to the delimitation of the key water conservation areas in Jilin province, China. The results showed that: (1) the spatial distribution pattern of water conservation in Jilin province gradually decreased from east to west. The spatial difference was significant. The maximum value of water conservation in Jilin province was 730 mm. From 1983 to 2016, water conservation, which accounted for 75.71% of the area, showed an upward trend. The overall water retention capacity showed the characteristics of the overall increase and the local decline. (2) From the absolute amount of the effect of unit area change on water conservation, the intensity from the high to the low was forestland, cultivated land, grassland, unused land, buildings, and water. (3) The area of water conservation less than 474 mm accounted for more than 80% of the total study area. The overall water retention capacity was low. High importance ecological space area of water conservation was comprehensively defined as 36.97%, which was mainly distributed in the natural forest area of Changbai Mountain in the east and the south of Song Liao Plain. Therefore, this study provided a basic layout of relatively concentrated ecological spatial distribution for water conservation types at different levels in Jilin province.

Natural disturbances such as fire, wind, and flooding strongly influence ecosystems by creating short and long-term ecological processes. Conservation management of protected areas should consider the importance of natural disturbances since natural shifts in ecosystems are, in a long-term perspective, necessary to maintain high biodiversity. The purpose of this study is to explore how and if natural disturbances are incorporated in the management of Swedish national parks and to identify possible examples of barriers for this incorporation. The design of the study is a multiple comparative case study based on a document study and completed with qualitative interviews. The cases consist of propositions and management plans for 15 Swedish national parks established between 1962 and 2018. The document analysis generated four main categories: historic/future and positive/negative perceptions of natural disturbances. The results indicate that there are positive perceptions concerning the inclusion of disturbance ecology in the management of national parks. However, there are also obstacles and challenges around natural disturbances within Swedish national parks. These obstacles are, in some cases, explained by practical implications such as the closeness to surrounding societies and in others explained by paradoxes such as visitors' perceptions of national parks and the wilderness.","[Davidsson, Asa; Johansson, Magnus] Karlstad Univ, Ctr Societal Risk Res, S-65188 Karlstad, Sweden; [Davidsson, Asa; Johansson, Magnus] Karlstad Univ, Ctr Nat Hazards & Disaster Sci, S-65188 Karlstad, Sweden; [Davidsson, Asa; Johansson, Magnus] Karlstad Univ, Fac Arts & Social Sci, S-65188 Karlstad, Sweden; [Bonander, Carl] Univ Gothenburg, Sch Publ Hlth & Community Med, Sahlgrenska Acad, S-41345 Gothenburg, Sweden",asa.davidsson@kau.se; magnus.johansson@kau.se; carl.bonander@kau.se,94,0,1,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,2021,Green Published,

Biodiversity conservation, in order to be effective as disease prevention, requires consideration of people's needs, knowledge and institutions within their locally specific contexts. To meet this goal, future biodiversity research and conservation policy should apply six social-ecological principles for shaping future practices of co-existence of societies and nature. Technical summary The COVID-19 pandemic, presumably originating in a spillover event from natural wildlife reservoirs into the human population, sets a new benchmark for the indirect cost of biodiversity exploitation. To reverse the trend of increasing pandemic risk, biodiversity conservation and wildlife protection must be strengthened globally. In this paper, we argue that such preventive measures explicitly need to employ a social-ecological approach. In particular, attention must be paid to the societal relations to nature to avoid falling for simplistic solutions that neglect regional and local particularities of both, biodiversity and local communities. We emphasize the importance of avoiding a Western-biased view and acknowledging the factors and causations of infectious disease emergence in industrialized countries. To reduce the emergence of zoonotic and vector-borne diseases in their specific contexts, we propose applying a social-ecological systems approach by integrating plural local knowledge and values, established practices, formal and informal institutions, as well as technology. We further introduce six social-ecological principles for shaping transformations in the Anthropocene to maintain and build more resilient and sustainable communities. By operationalizing these inter- and transdisciplinary principles, biodiversity conservation can be effectively implemented as infectious disease prevention.

To identify these factors, we chose 290 Chinese prefecture-level cities to analyze the driving factors behind urbanization using spatial regression analysis, and explored the spatial differences among regions in these factors. Our results show that industrial upgrading and technological progress were the main factors that promoted coordinated development, with industrialization having positive effects under government management, but with differences among regions in how the driving forces affected coordinated development.

Hence, this article discusses that intersubjective relationship practice in preserving, maintaining, and protecting sustainable forest by assimilating the SAD's customary-religious values and the state zoning system. Moreover, this article also complements the shortcomings ofprevious researchers who believe that SAD's cosmology is animistic and proves that the TNBD zoning system's implementation as a cause of the SAD conflict. After conducting the interviews and the observations supported by relevant literature sources, this article shows that the SAD believes that the cosmos is not only inhabited by humans, but there are nonhuman beings such as animals and Badewo who are perceived as a human in which they are believed as social actors in forest conservation. SAD and nonhuman beings live together and contribute to each other and have a mutual relationship to life sustainability in the forest or so-called indigenous religion.

Therefore, efficiency of drip irrigation method was evaluated in a field experiment. The experiment using drip irrigation as reclamation method was carried out that included five soil matric potentials (SMPs) controlled at -5, -10, -15, -20 and -25 kPa (treatments S1-S5, respectively) directly under drip emitters at 20 cm depth. Measures including vegetation collocation, high-raised ridge and three-stage drip irrigation scheduling were adopted. Results showed that SMP thresholds significantly affected the spatial distributions of both electrical conductivity (ECe) and sodium adsorption ratio (SARe) based on extracts of saturated paste. The low salinity and SARe zones either kept enlarging or remained stable when SMP thresholds were above -20 kPa. However, for treatment S5(-25 kPa), these gradually shrank with time. By the end of the second year, the average ECe values in treatments S1-S5 were 2.05, 2.59, 3.36, 3.05 and 3.9 dS m(-1), respectively, indicating that ECe increased linearly as SMP threshold decreased. The SARe showed the same trend, with corresponding values of 9.56, 10.48, 12.26, 12.82 and 15.23 (mmol L-1)(0.5). The pH of the saturated soil extract (pHe) in all treatments increased from 7.64 to around 8.00 and was not significantly affected by treatments. Moreover, the two-year survival rates of the dominant trees were > 87.5% when SMP threshold was above -20 kPa. The growth indexes of plants reduced with the decrease in SMP thresholds and statistical analysis suggested that -20 to -17 kPa was an important SMP range, below which the forage yield of the herbaceous legume Astragalus adsurgens dropped sharply. This study suggested the SMP threshold of -20 kPa was important for drip irrigation scheduling and the drip irrigation, combined with ridging plantation, was efficient for both vegetation reclamation and reclaiming saline soils in these saline areas with shallow ground water.","[Dong, Shide; Wan, Shuqin; Kang, Yaohu; Li, Xiaobin] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Key Lab Water Cycle & Related Land Surface Proc, 11A Datun Rd, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Kang, Yaohu] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Coll Resources & Environm, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Dong, Shide] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China",kangyh@igsnrr.ac.cn,33,5,5,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0378-3774,AGR WATER MANAGE,Agric.

In this study, water conservation was selected as an indicator of ecosystem function to explore the impact of the project by using the water yield module of the Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs (InVEST) model and geographic statistical methods. Water yield and land-use changes were quantitatively evaluated, and significant changes in the wetland landscape configuration occurred after the PER project because forest beach, moss marshland and mudflat areas were transformed into a poplar-retreat area. Thus, the proportion of the poplar-retreat area and average water yield increased. By using the principal component and cluster analysis methods, climate change and landscape patterns were shown to be the dominant driving factors affecting water conservation under stable meteorological conditions. Moreover, the landscape heterogeneity that resulted from the landscape patterns had a greater impact than climate change, which means that reducing human activities can enhance water conservation. Additionally, the correlation between landscape heterogeneity and water yield indicated that reducing landscape fragmentation and improving aggregation also benefit water conservation. Therefore, the PER project is successful at enhancing ecological functions and protecting wetland environments, and it represents a good example of maintaining ecological sustainability despite local economic performance restrictions. This project serves as an important reference for the establishment of sustainable wetland ecological policies by national governments, and the results can provide theoretical support for landscape ecology and eco-hydrology research.","[Hu, Wenmin; Li, Guo; Jia, Guanyu; Wang, Zhongchen] Cent South Univ Forestry & Technol, Changsha 410004, Peoples R China; [Hu, Wenmin; Gao, Zhihai] Chinese Acad Forestry, Res Inst Forest Resources Informat Tech, Beijing 100001, Peoples R China; [Li, Yi] Hunan Agr Univ, Changsha 410015, Peoples R China",liguo@webmail.hzau.edu.cn; zhgao@ifrit.ac.cn,48,25,28,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0048-9697,SCI TOTAL ENVIRON,Sci.

Establishing an effective conservation plan is complicated by ongoing and novel threats as well as by aspects of the species' ecology that remain unstudied due to its neophobic and nocturnal behaviour. To identify areas where additional research is needed, we conducted a comprehensive search of the literature published on the northern hairy-nosed wombat from 1980 to 2019 to identify where knowledge gaps exist and to suggest where future efforts may be focussed. We found that the breeding ecology, in particular, of the northern hairy-nosed wombat is largely unstudied but could be vital in conservation efforts. Further, there is a need to establish additional populations, and several threats - including disease, invasive species, and climate change - may require ongoing management action to ensure the species' longevity.","[Martin, Alynn M.; Carver, Scott] Univ Tasmania, Sch Nat Sci, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia",alynn.martin@utas.edu.au,47,0,0,CSIRO PUBLISHING,CLAYTON,"UNIPARK, BLDG 1, LEVEL 1, 195 WELLINGTON RD, LOCKED BAG 10, CLAYTON, VIC 3168, AUSTRALIA",0310-0049,AUST MAMMAL,Aust.

Focusing on Kerry, Ireland, it highlights the difficulties that conservation of upland bog, heath and grassland habitats faces due to rural depopulation. It then uses landscape history to assess the long-term feasibility of conserving/restoring these habitats according to EU directives, pointing to the remarkably recent disappearance of woodland due to grazing and deforestation. Instead of being 'traditional', as conservation discourse holds it to be, historical management of uplands by farmers could vary greatly depending on socio-political factors and economic trends. I discuss how this historical ecology of change helps to explain the failure of conservation in parts of Ireland, and outline how 'lessons from the past' may contribute to sustainable upland management if co-evolution is accepted as an on-going process.","[Costello, Eugene] Stockholm Univ, Dept Archaeol & Class Studies, Environm Humanities, Stockholm, Sweden",eugene.costello@arklab.su.se,57,3,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0142-6397,LANDSCAPE RES,Landsc.

Over the past few decades, the implementation of MPAs has achieved mixed results with regard to conservation goals, which has driven the scientific community to contemplate what factors may determine the effectiveness of an MPA. Most previous analyses have tended to focus on the design criteria of MPAs as well as post-closure management capabilities, but pre-closure conditions are seldom considered. Here, we investigate the effects of varying pre-closure fishing effort scenarios on MPA performance by applying a developed evaluation framework and age-structured dynamic model for the small yellow croaker (Larimichthys polyactis) in Haizhou Bay, China. We specifically focus on the overall fishing pressure imposed on the fish population and the spatial heterogeneity of fishing effort. We used ecological and social indicators to evaluate the effects of MPAs. Our results demonstrate that MPAs with lower pre-closure fishing pressure are more effective than thosewith higher pre-closure fishing pressure in recovering the fish population. Highly aggregated fishing efforts inside the MPAs prior to their implementations could also make MPAs less effective. By comparing our findings to other studies, we noticed that evaluation metrics and time frames could make a difference in determining the effects of a given MPA, which indicates the importance of monitoring programs. From a social perspective, placing MPAs in heavily exploited areas without additional harvest regulations may result in a tragedy of the commons situation that leads to a significant loss in catches. This study highlights the ecological and social risks of establishing MPAs under different pre-closure fishing scenarios and provides insights for the development of marine conservation plans.

This study measured the degree of urban clusters by utilizing the panel data of 278 cities in China during 2004-2016. Then, an extended meta-frontier data envelopment analysis (EM-DEA) model was applied to estimate the total-factor ecological performance (UTEP) and decompose it into two sub-index from the perspective of resource conservation and environmental friendliness. On these bases, we employed a dynamic panel data approach to examine and demonstrate the relationship between urban cluster and UTEP in two dimensions, and further explored transmission channels of urban clusters on UTEP by adding the mediating effect. The results show that resource conservation increases first and then decreases with the increasing of urban clustering level, while environmental friendliness showed the opposite trend, making the latter become the main way for urban clusters to improve the UTEP. Industrial structure supererogation and rationalization are transmission channels for environmental friendliness rather than resource conservation in the way of improvement of UTEP. Technology innovation, as well as technology diffusion, also improves UTEP to some extent. In addition, urban clusters in eastern and central China have the greatest improvement in UTEP, while such effects are not the case in western China. Urban clusters in the second half sample period are more conducive to the improvement of the UTEP, with these potentially being the gains from the improvement of the level and quality of urban clusters.","[Chen, Peirong; Lu, Mingxuan] Guangzhou Univ, Sch Econ & Stat, Guangzhou 510006, Peoples R China; [Chen, Peirong] Hengyang Normal Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Hengyang 421008, Peoples R China; [Xie, Ruhe] Guangzhou Univ, Sch Management, Guangzhou 510006, Peoples R China; [Lu, Mingxuan] Hunan Inst Technol, Sch Safety & Environm Engn, Hengyang 421008, Peoples R China",1111764008@e.gzhu.edu.cn; rhxie@gzhu.edu.cn; lumingxuan@e.gzhu.edu.cn,78,2,2,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,INT J ENV RES PUB HE,Int.

In south-eastern Australia, remnants of critically endangered natural grasslands are increasingly being isolated in urban areas. Urbanisation has led to reduced fire frequency and woody plant encroachment in some patches. Grasslands are currently being managed under the assumption that desirable management actions to address these threats (prescribed burning and removing woody vegetation) (1) lead to improved conservation outcomes and (2) are restricted by negative public attitudes. In this study, we tested these two assumptions in the context of native grassland conservation reserves in Melbourne, Australia. Firstly, we investigated differences in species and functional trait composition between patches that had been recently burnt, patches that were unburnt and patches subject to woody vegetation encroachment. We found that the functional traits of species converged in areas subject to woody plant encroachment and areas frequently disturbed by fire. Burning promoted native species, and patches of woody plants supressed the dominant grass, providing a wider range of habitat conditions. Secondly, we surveyed 477 residents living adjacent to these grassland conservation reserves to measure values, beliefs and attitudes and the acceptance of prescribed burning and removing woody vegetation. We found conflict in people's attitudes to grasslands, with both strongly positive and strongly negative attitudes expressed. The majority of residents found prescribed burning an acceptable management practice (contrary to expectations) and removing trees and shrubs from grasslands to be unacceptable. Both cognitive factors (values and beliefs) and landscape features were important in influencing these opinions. This research provides some guidance for managing urban grassland reserves as a social-ecological system, showing that ecological management, community education and engagement and landscape design features can be integrated to influence social and ecological outcomes.","[Farrar, Alison] Dept Environm Land Water & Planning, Warrnambool 3280, Australia; [Kendal, Dave] Univ Tasmania, Sch Technol Environm & Design, Hobart, Tas 7000, Australia; [Williams, Kathryn J.

We find that context matters, e.g., higher jurisdictional population density was positively associated with prioritizing tree cover and diversity.

Here, we used bibliometric analyses for a comparative assessment to determine if geographical patterns of research changed or remained consistent between the periods, 1987-1995 and 2007-2015. Our results revealed an absence of a marked increase in geographical diversity of research. Imbalances persisted in global research efforts in five leading journals, with research productivity remaining significantly correlated to national differences in wealth. There is a disparity between where scientific research continues to be conducted and where hotspots of biodiversity are known to exist as indicated by our study and several other recent papers.

Conservation actions are inefficient when the needs and suggestions of local populations are disregarded in conservation decision making and doing so often generates social-environmental conflicts. In addition, the lack of dialogue between ecologists, managing entities, and local populations has increased the challenges associated with the conservation of diverse natural resources in a various ecosystems and has resulted in many species being threatened with local extinction. In this article, we emphasize local ecological knowledge (LEK) as an emergent property of social-ecological systems and demonstrate that it is necessary to consider LEK in ecological conservation studies. In addition, we discuss the challenges and limitations that can arise in conservation-oriented ecological studies, with an emphasis on establishing good rapport with local communities. Science has a great responsibility to find viable alternatives in order to circumvent social-environmental conflicts. Thus, if the goal of academics and managing entities is biological conservation while safeguarding the needs of local populations, knowledge and natural resource management suggestions from local communities must be considered in order to minimize conflict.

Evoking contemporary models of rhetoric, I show that Du Bois implicitly figured blackness as an inventive rhetorical ecology that was distributed through material things and environments. Promoting the conservation of that ecology, his sociological work gestured toward a worldly, more-than-human ideal of justice. I explore how his ecological articulation of conservation resonated with Progressive Era environmental conservation in its rejection of ideals of purity but pressed beyond its economic materialism and human essentialism. Ultimately, I argue, Du Bois leaves us with a unique picture of conservation as a cooperative practice of identification in which both human and nonhuman participants come to articulate as interdependent parts of a larger ecology, a process that involves memory at a lived, material level.","[Wells, Justine] New Mexico State Univ, Dept English, POB 30001,MSC 3E, Las Cruces, NM 88003 USA",jbwells@nmsu.edu,73,2,2,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0277-3945,RHETOR SOC Q,Rhetor.

This study used qualitative interviewing, participant observation, and content analysis to demonstrate how narratives about conservation are enmeshed in valuing judgements that steer conservation towards certain solutions (e.g. protected areas, community management), embody and alter the interactions and relationships of others, and produce specific social and ecological consequences, such as changes to use rights and social practices.

The most important ecological theory achieved is that the seasonal fluctuation of the salinity gradient creates an ecocline influenced by gradual changes between river-dominated to marine-like waters. Estuarine fish fauna adapts to these changeable abiotic characteristics, including the spatial, and seasonal bioavailability of dissolved oxygen and numerous pollutants. However, studies on the influence of the estuarine ecocline are still missing for key estuarine systems. This study provides an overview of fish ecology and anthropogenic impacts within estuarine systems of SA and discusses priorities for environmental conservation. Research on fish reached important conclusions regarding essential habitats and fish interaction with other biological and abiotic compartments over spatio-temporal settings, including conditions of severe anthropogenic impacts. These impacts are related to unplanned urban settlements, industrial estates, ports, damming of major rivers, dredging activities, and deforestation for extensive farming. Changes in estuarine morphology alter natural flows and lead to habitat losses, disrupting the ecocline and impairing fishes from moving among formerly connected habitats, especially earlier ontogenetic phases. In addition, industrial, urban, and farming activities often result in high loads of metals and persistent organic pollutants, organic enrichment and oxygen depletion. Moreover, plastic debris, a ubiquitous contaminant with sources on every human activity, including fishing, when fragmented into microplastics, become preferably concentrated in semi-enclosed environments, as estuaries. Metals, POPs and microplastics are actually asserted to be persistent. When in high concentrations, they become bioavailable to the estuarine trophic web through bioaccumulation, being biomagnified or biotransfered toward higher trophic level organisms, such as top predator fishes. Therefore, research on environmental quality and fish ecology must be based on robust sampling designs along the whole ecocline using long-term approaches. In addition, basic sanitation, co-management, an improved licensing system and scientifically-based risk assessments/monitoring for all sorts of enterprise are also urgent. These conservation priorities need to be in place before human-driven changes surpass the ecosystem's capacity to produce resources and maintain services.","[Barletta, Mario; Lima, Andre R.

Urban ecological land can be defined as the natural base on which a city relies to ecologically survive. It closely links the social economy with the natural eco-environment, providing an important integrated approach to resolve the contradiction between urban expansion and natural ecosystems conservation in the process of urbanization. The research question addressed in this study is how to accurately identify the conservation priority areas for urban ecological land. Taking Zhuhai City, located in China, as an example, an approach based on seven kinds of water ecosystem services was put forward, combining social demand and natural supply for the services to determine service targets and conservation priority areas. The results showed that the conservation priority areas in Zhuhai City covered 868 km(2), accounting for 51.03% of the total land area, which were mainly covered by woodlands or paddy fields and fish ponds. In addition, by synthesizing ecological importance and ecological sensitivity, management zones for urban ecological land were delineated, including 510 km(2) of primary control areas and 358 km(2) of secondary control areas.

How environmental factors influence elasmobranch behavior, habitat use, and movement patterns is still relatively poorly understood, in part because of the scale over which many of these animals roam and the remote nature of the marine ecosystems they inhabit. In the last decade there has been an explosion of satellite remote sensing (SRS) technologies that can cover these vast spatial scales for the marine environment. Consequentially, SRS presents an opportunity to analyze important environmental drivers in elasmobranch ecology and to aid management decisions for the conservation of declining populations. A systematic literature review was undertaken to synthesize the current use of SRS environmental data in elasmobranch research. In addition, to facilitate the use of SRS in this field moving forward, we have compiled a list of popular SRS data sources and sensors for common environmental variables in marine science. Our review of 71 papers (55 published in the last 10 years) identified ten SRS-derived environmental variables that have been used in elasmobranch studies, from a range of satellite sensors and data sources. Sea surface temperature and ocean productivity were the most frequently used variables. Articles primarily analyzed variables individually or in pairs, with few studies looking at a suite of interacting variables. Here, we present a summary of the current state of knowledge on the application of SRS, current gaps and limitations, and discuss some of the potential future directions in which we envisage this field developing. Threatened elasmobranch populations inhabit some of the world's most remote marine ecosystems. With often global coverage, SRS presents an opportunity to analyze the important environmental drivers of elasmobranch ecology to aid management decisions for the conservation of declining and threatened populations.","[Williamson, Michael J.; Tebbs, Emma J.; Dawson, Terence P.] Kings Coll London, Dept Geog, London, England; [Williamson, Michael J.; Jacoby, David M.

I present four general principles to guide strategies aimed at meeting these challenges: (1) protect and restore populations of key species and their habitats, (2) conserve and restore key attributes of stand structural complexity, (3) maintain and restore natural patterns of landscape heterogeneity, and (4) maintain and restore key ecological processes. The complexity associated with these principles is that how they will be practically implemented on the ground will invariably be ecosystem specific as what constitutes stand structural complexity or landscape heterogeneity will vary between ecosystems. Here I demonstrate the practical application of the four general principles in a detailed case study of conservation and restoration in the Mountain Ash (Eucalyptus regnans) forests of the Central Highlands of Victoria, southeastern Australia. These forests are characterized by declining species, loss of key elements of stand structural, loss of old growth forest, altered patterns of landscape heterogeneity, and altered ecosystem processes. I highlight how altered management practices in Mountain Ash forests that are guided by our four general principles can help conserve existing biodiversity and underpin effective forest restoration. Consideration of our general principles also can identify policy deficiencies that need to be addressed to enhance restoration and biodiversity conservation.","[Lindenmayer, David B.] Australian Natl Univ, Fenner Sch Environm & Soc, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia; [Lindenmayer, David B.] Australian Natl Univ, Fenner Sch Environm & Soc, Threated Species Recovery Hub, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia",David.Lindenmayer@anu.edu.au,45,9,9,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0169-4286,NEW FOREST,New For.,2019,Green Submitted,

The grades of ESTI in many sub-regions improved from II or III to IV or V, and fluctuations in the level of ESTI sharply increased. Additionally, a gray relational grade model was used to calculate the gray correlation degree of the factors affecting ESTI in Beijing's ECDA. The main factors affecting ESTI in the Beijing ECDA were the response and factors related to government decisions and actions. A number of environmental indicators and indicators that gauge the development of the tourism economy have had an important impact on ESTI in the Beijing ECDA. This study explores new perspectives in the hope of developing a better understanding of the relationship between the sustainable development of the tourism industry and the ecological security of ECDAs. Such an understanding could enrich theories of tourism ecology and support the green development of the tourism industry.

In this paper, ecosystem service benefits of the Tibet Ecological Conservation Project were comprehensively assessed by estimating and mapping the spatiotemporal variation patterns of critical ecosystem services on the Tibet Plateau from 2000 to 2015. Furthermore, we linked the benefit assessment to the sustainable spatial planning of future ecological conservation strategies. Comparing the 8 years before and after the project, the water retention and carbon sink services of the forest, grassland and wetland ecosystems were slightly increased after the project, and the ecosystem sand fixation service has been steadily enhanced. The increasing forage supply service of grassland significantly reduced the grassland carrying pressure and eased the conflict between grassland and livestock. However, enhanced rainfall erosivity occurred due to increased rainfall, and root-layer soils could not recover in a short period of time, both factors have led to a decline in soil conservation service. The warm and humid climate is beneficial for the restoration of ecosystems on the Tibet Plateau, and the implementation of the Tibet Ecological Conservation Project has had a positive effect on the local improvement of ecosystem services.

Each field has distinct intellectual and disciplinary roots, bodies of theory, norms of practice, institutions, and modes of professional discourse. Yet both aim to understand and wisely steward environments for the benefit of humans and non-human nature, and both grapple with similar issues inherent in the complex nexus of nature, society, history, and sustainability. Increasingly, the thinking and the practices that once clearly distinguished their respective efforts have begun to converge - reaching similar conclusions on challenging issues, and thus building consilience. Coincident with this trend toward consilience, the concept of novel ecosystems has arisen. Novel ecosystems are ecological assemblages that form self-organizing systems that have no historical precedent. We argue that the novel ecosystems concept is a useful frame through which to expose, articulate, and address many of the philosophical, ethical, and pragmatic challenges and tradeoffs that cultural landscape conservationists and ecological restorationists grapple with today: the fuzzy lines that distinguish humans from nature, the impossibility of going back in time, the resulting problems of defining goals given diversity of potential priorities, and the value of greater social inclusivity in the practice of restoration. We believe novel ecosystems also provide a powerful bridging concept through which we can understand and align with one another's epistemological perspectives, and continue building consilience and collaborations to conserve, steward, and celebrate our cultural and natural heritage and environment.","[Macdonald, Eric] Univ Georgia, Coll Environm & Design, 285 S Jackson St, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [King, Elizabeth G.] Univ Georgia, Odom Sch Ecol, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [King, Elizabeth G.] Univ Georgia, Warnell Sch Forestry & Nat Resources, Athens, GA 30602 USA",eamacdon@uga.edu; egking@uga.edu,168,9,9,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0169-2046,LANDSCAPE URBAN PLAN,Landsc.

Using a water-balance approach in this study, we used runoff plots from three sites, each representing a different agro-ecological environment, e.g., high, mid and low in both elevation and rainfall, in the Upper Blue Nile Basin of Ethiopia to examine the runoff response and runoff conservation efficiency of a range of different soil and water conservation measures and their impacts on soil moisture. The plots at each site represented common land use types (cultivated vs. non-agricultural land use types) and slopes (gentle and steep). Seasonal runoff from control plots in the highlands ranged 214-560 versus 253-475 mm at midlands and 119-200 mm at lowlands. The three soil and water conservation techniques applied in cultivated land increased runoff conservation efficiency by 32% to 51%, depending on the site. At the moist subtropical site in a highland region, soil and water conservation increased soil moisture enough to potentially cause waterlogging, which was absent at the lowrainfall sites. Soil bunds combined with Vetiveria zizanioides grass in cultivated land and short trenches in grassland conserved the most runoff (51% and 55%, respectively). Runoff responses showed high spatial variation within and between land use types, causing high variation in soil and water conservation efficiency. Our results highlight the need to understand the role of the agro-ecological environment in the success of soil and water conservation measures to control runoff and hydrological dynamics. This understanding will support policy development to promote the adoption of suitable techniques that can be tested at other locations with similar soil, climatic, and topographic conditions.","[Sultan, Dagnenet; Fenta, Ayele A.; Ebabu, Kindiye] Tottori Univ, United Grad Sch Agr Sci, Tottori 6808553, Japan; [Sultan, Dagnenet] Bahir Dar Univ, Inst Technol, Sch Civil & Water Resource Engn, Bahir Dar, Ethiopia; [Tsunekawa, Atsushi; Meshesha, Derege T.] Tottori Univ, Arid Land Res Ctr, Tottori 6800001, Japan; [Haregeweyn, Nigussie] Tottori Univ, Int Platform Dryland Res & Educ, Tottori 6800001, Japan; [Adgo, Enyew; Meshesha, Derege T.; Ebabu, Kindiye] Bahir Dar Univ, Dept Nat Resources Management, Bahir Dar, Ethiopia; [Tsubo, Mitsuru] Agr Res Council, Inst Soil Climate & Water, ZA-0083 Pretoria, South Africa; [Masunaga, Tsugiyuki] Shimane Univ, Fac Life & Environm Sci, Matsue, Shimane 6900823, Japan; [Aklog, Dagnachew] Tottori Univ, Ctr Int Affairs, Tottori 6808550, Japan",dags120@yahoo.com,43,23,24,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1674-6767,J ARID LAND,J.

Most of the 25 National Key Ecological Function Areas (NKEFAs) in China serve as a source and supplementation for numerous rivers and playing an important role in water resource conservation. Based on the analysis of eco-environmental quality changes in NKEFAs, this study analyzed the spatial pattern of water conservation services in 2000 and 2010 by using a water balance equation. The results indicate that the land cover type of NKEFAs was dominated by grassland, and the proportion of ecological land conversion to non-ecological land (0.3%) was higher than that of non-ecological land conversion to ecological land (0.21%). The fractional vegetation coverage (FVC) and biomass density of NKEFAs gradually decreased from southeast to northwest. The FVC of the Changbai Mountain Forest Function Area (CBS) was the highest, while the biomass density and total biomass were highest in mountain areas in the Middle of Hai'nan Island (HND) and in the Great Khingan and Lesser Khingan Mountains (XAL) respectively. The FVC and biomass of NKEFAs mostly increased in 2000-2010. Water conservation amounts of NKEFAs decreased from southeast to northwest. The average water conservation and total water conservation amount of Nanling Mountain (NL), Guangxi-Guizhou-Yunnan (GQD), and the Wuling Mountain Function Area (WLS) were the highest, while the Yinshan Mountain (YS), Alkin Grassland (AEJ), and the Qilian Mountain Function Area (QLS) had the lowest values. In 2000-2010, the water conservation service of 60% of NKEFAs decreased. Spatial and temporal differences in water conservation services are the result of a combination of ecological environment quality and meteorological conditions. Protection of the ecological environment and vegetation coverage improvement should be strengthened to enhance the function of water conservation.","[Xu, Jie; Xie, Gaodi; Xiao, Yu; Yu, Fuqin] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Xu, Jie; Xie, Gaodi; Xiao, Yu; Yu, Fuqin] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Coll Resources & Environm, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Li, Na] China Aerosp Sci & Ind Acad Informat Technol, Beijing 100070, Peoples R China; [Pei, Sha] Beijing Municipal Res Inst Environm Protect, Beijing 100037, Peoples R China; [Jiang, Yuan] Beijing Normal Univ, Fac Geog Sci, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China",xuj.16b@igsnrr.ac.cn; xiegd@igsnrr.ac.cn; xiaoy@igsnrr.ac.cn; lin.12b@igsnrr.ac.cn; yufq.17b@igsnrr.ac.cn; peisha_259@163.com; jiangy@bnu.edu.cn,42,5,7,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,2018,"gold, Green Submitted",

It was aimed with this study to develop a new planning concept for determining nature conservation and restoration priority areas based on the basic principles of ecological value analysis, which is widely used today in many developed countries. Yedigoller National Park (Bolu) was selected as study area. Ecological value analysis was performed with the assessment of data collected from 80 sample plots related to 16 parameters, which are the rarity of plant communities and their spatial distribution, hemeroby degrees, diversity and rarity of plant taxa, endemic plant taxa, some components of forest structure (layerness, stand age, mixture type, mixture rate, canopy closure) and deadwood amount by using relation matrices and direct scoring. The results revealed that; (1) there is a rather variable landscape structure depending on naturalness, diversity of habitats, species diversity, rarity and endemism, (2) 90% of the study area has medium ecological value, (3) detailed ecological value scale scores ranges between 15-30, (4) anthropogenic disturbance is mainly determined in the area close to the lakes, (5) use of many parameters as possible considering the landscape structure improved the sensitivity of the analysis as well as providing the sophisticated analysis of the study area.","[Kirca, Simay; Altincekic, Hakan T.] Istanbul Univ, Dept Landscape Planning & Design, Fac Forestry, TR-34473 Istanbul, Turkey",simay@istanbul.edu.tr,112,1,1,ISTANBUL UNIV,ISTANBUL,"VETERINER FAKULTESI, ISTANBUL, 00000, TURKEY",,FORESTIST,Forestist,2018,,

The analysis of causes of decline based on data sampled in declining populations in sub-optimal habitats risks overlooking necessary environmental factors because they are no longer present at the sites. It may therefore be necessary to search for conditions that were present before the species began to decline. We used an historical ecology approach to identify critical ecological needs for the endangered butterfly Clouded Apollo, Parnassius mnemosyne, in Sweden in relation to historical and current land use. The most suitable habitat structure and management was transformed into a plan for restoration and management, applied at two P. mnemosyne sites. The populations of P. mnemosyne and its host-plant, Corydalis solida, were monitored annually 2004-2014. Based on previous knowledge about P. mnemosyne, the Swedish plan for conservation of the species recommends regular clearings of shrubs and trees in order to maintain a mosaic tree-grassland habitat, and a limited of removal of ground biomass. Our analysis suggested an alternative management approach, late and rather intense grazing. The populations of P. mnemosyne and its host plant increased in response to this management regime and the butterfly started dispersing to new sites. We suggest a structured method for combining ecological and historical knowledge, which can reveal habitat conditions difficult to detect in the field today, but that are of crucial importance for successful species conservation.","[Westin, Anna; Lennartsson, Tommy] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Swedish Biodivers Ctr, Uppsala, Sweden; [Bjorklund, Jan-Olov] Vasternas 1, Herrang, Sweden",Anna.Westin@slu.se,90,3,3,AMER INST MATHEMATICAL SCIENCES-AIMS,SPRINGFIELD,"PO BOX 2604, SPRINGFIELD, MO 65801-2604 USA",2372-0344,AIMS ENVIRON SCI,AIMS Environ.

Efforts to increase conservation involvement would benefit from a deeper understanding of the relative strength of these factors in specific landscapes. This study examined these factors specifically in the context of wetland conservation, based on a 2017 survey of Missouri residents (n = 4076). We used multiple linear regression to analyze how wildlife recreation participation predicted awareness of wetland ecological benefits, as well as connection to wetlands. Then, we used logistic regression to analyze how demographic characteristics, wildlife recreation participation in wetlands, awareness, and connection predicted individual involvement in wetland conservation. 19% of respondents reported engaging in at least one wetland-related conservation behavior in the previous year. Compared to non-participants, we found that both wildlife viewers and waterfowl hunters were significantly more aware of wetland ecological benefits, more connected to wetlands, and more likely to be involved in wetland conservation. Connection to wetlands was a considerably stronger predictor of conservation involvement than was awareness of wetland ecological benefits. Our results suggest that promoting connection to wetlands, particularly through increased participation in wildlife recreation, may contribute to more widespread involvement in wetland conservation.","[Rutter, Jonathan D.; Dayer, Ashley A.] Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Dept Fish & Wildlife Conservat, Cheatham Hall,310 W Campus Dr, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA; [Raedeke, Andrew H.] Missouri Dept Conservat, 3500 E Gans Rd, Columbia, MO 65201 USA",jonathanrutter8@gmail.com,60,0,0,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0277-5212,WETLANDS,Wetlands,2022,,

However, the many thousands of existing bio-logging datasets are not easily discoverable, universally comparable, nor readily accessible through existing repositories and across platforms, slowing down ecological research and effective management. A set of universal standards is needed to ensure discoverability, interoperability and effective translation of bio-logging data into research and management recommendations. We propose a standardisation framework adhering to existing data principles (FAIR: Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable; and TRUST: Transparency, Responsibility, User focus, Sustainability and Technology) and involving the use of simple templates to create a data flow from manufacturers and researchers to compliant repositories, where automated procedures should be in place to prepare data availability into four standardised levels: (a) decoded raw data, (b) curated data, (c) interpolated data and (d) gridded data. Our framework allows for integration of simple tabular arrays (e.g. csv files) and creation of sharable and interoperable network Common Data Form (netCDF) files containing all the needed information for accuracy-of-use, rightful attribution (ensuring data providers keep ownership through the entire process) and data preservation security. We show the standardisation benefits for all stakeholders involved, and illustrate the application of our framework by focusing on marine animals and by providing examples of the workflow across all data levels, including filled templates and code to process data between levels, as well as templates to prepare netCDF files ready for sharing. Adoption of our framework will facilitate collection of Essential Ocean Variables (EOVs) in support of the Global Ocean Observing System (GOOS) and inter-governmental assessments (e.g. the World Ocean Assessment), and will provide a starting point for broader efforts to establish interoperable bio-logging data formats across all fields in animal ecology.","[Sequeira, Ana M.

Tamalpais Springs, Marin County, California",ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS,Springs; Ecohydrology; Ecological management; Geomorphology; Hydrogeology; Indicators,,"Spring ecosystems are keystone habitats, providing refugia and supporting high levels of ecological biodiversity and productivity. However, they are often overlooked, overdeveloped, or destroyed altogether. Protocol and inventory methods exist that provide detailed and quantified data collection that enable land managers to monitor and assess their ecological indicators. These methods typically require expertise from many fields, which limits the ability of land managers with lower economic and human resources to implement them on landscape scales. This study presents the Adapted Springs Ecosystem Assessment Protocol (A-SEAP), a simple adaptation of well-established methods as a preliminary, low cost method to evaluate ecological indicators of springs and identify areas of concern. Findings are used to prioritize regions and springs for monitoring and restoration using the rigorous established methods. For this study, a total of 72 springs were evaluated on Mount Tamalpais in Marin County California, a managed wildland surrounded by urban developments. Our assessment showed that spring geomorphology was distributed as follows: hillslope (56) rheocrene (10) > helocrene (3) ? limnocrene (3). Of those, 20 have anthropogenic influences due to roads or trails. Vegetation inventories revealed that springs supported 96% native species, 3% invasive species, and 1% rare and endemic species. Nearly 10% of all native species, as well as 10% of wetland species known in the area of interest were found in only 0.005% of the landscape. Among these springs, slope was negatively correlated to habitat area (r = -0.42, p < 0.001) and was positively related to discharge (r = 0.614, p < 0.001). There was no correlation between discharge and vegetation cover (r = -0.007, p = 0.8). A-SEAP demonstrated that the majority of springs in this region have fair ecohydrologic integrity relative to other spring studies, with a mean value of 3.62 out of 6. A-SEAP indicators identified springs located in Mt. Tamalpais State Park as lower ecohydrologic integrity than springs in the protected Marin Municipal Water District. A-SEAP indicators also successfully identified springs in need of restoration that fit the goals of the local land management agencies. Our results demonstrate that Mount Tamalpais springs are ecologically significant and require further inventory, monitoring, and conservation attention.","[Kurzweil, Jake R.; Abdi, Reza; Hogue, Terri S.] Colorado Sch Mines, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Hydrol Sci & Engn Program, 1500 Illinois St, Golden, CO 80401 USA; [Stevens, Larry] Springs Stewardship Inst, 3101 N Ft Valley Rd, Flagstaff, AZ 86001 USA",Jkurzweil@mymail.mines.edu,57,0,0,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1470-160X,ECOL INDIC,Ecol.

The Dinaric Alps, as a part of the Balkan Peninsula, harbour a high number of endemic species, some of them comprising a small number of populations, which are often endangered. We investigated spatial distribution, community composition, site ecology, genetic diversity and conservation ofDegenia velebitica, a stenoendemic species of the north-western Dinaric Alps. Our results showed thatD. velebiticais nowadays restricted to three localities with the area of occupancy of 48,560 m(2), harbouring approximately 37,000 individuals.Degenia velebiticastands are differentiated into three well-characterized, floristically homogenous syntaxa, very distinct from the surrounding vegetation, suggesting their azonal occurrence and restriction to spatially highly fragmented microsites exposed to stormy winds. Spatial distances of populations, differences inD. velebiticacommunity composition and site ecology are mirrored in genetic variation patterns of the populations, such as high-frequency down-weighted marker values in the north-western populations and high gene diversity in the south-eastern group of populations. The fact that we could not find a singleD. velebiticaindividual at thelocus classicusindicates the existence of the ever-growing fragmentation. The analyses of genetic structure using AFLP data recognized two main genetic groups of populations as evolutionary significant units that should be considered when planning protection measures. According to our IUCN Red List reassessment,D. velebiticashould be treated as a critically endangered species that requires immediate conservation actions.","[Liber, Zlatko; Nikolic, Toni; Skrtic, Danijel] Univ Zagreb, Fac Sci, Dept Biol, Div Bot, Marulicev Trg 9A, Zagreb 10000, Croatia; [Liber, Zlatko; Satovic, Zlatko] Ctr Excellence Biodivers & Mol Plant Breeding CoE, Svetosimunska Cesta 25, Zagreb 10000, Croatia; [Satovic, Zlatko] Univ Zagreb, Fac Agr, Dept Seed Sci & Technol, Svetosimunska 25, Zagreb 10000, Croatia; [Surina, Bostjan] Nat Hist Museum Rijeka, Lorenzov Prolaz 1, Rijeka 51000, Croatia; [Surina, Bostjan] Univ Primorska, Fac Math Nat Sci & Informat Technol, Glagoljaska 8, Koper 6000, Slovenia",zlatko.liber@biol.pmf.hr; bostjan.surina@prirodoslovni.com; toni.nikolic@biol.pmf.hr; danijel.skrtic@stud.biol.pmf.hr; zsatovic@agr.hr,158,2,2,SPRINGER WIEN,WIEN,"SACHSENPLATZ 4-6, PO BOX 89, A-1201 WIEN, AUSTRIA",0378-2697,PLANT SYST EVOL,Plant Syst.

This double-parameter ecological operation chart (DEOC) was obtained by incorporating limited ecological curves into original conventional operation chart (COC) and then establishing and solving the operation optimization model considering both ecological profits and hydropower generation. Unlike COC where reservoirs are operated based on the current water level, reservoir operation under DEOC is based on both current reservoir water level and inflow. A case study was conducted in Jasajiang (JS) and Madushan (MDS) cascade reservoirs on the Yuan River in southwestern China. The monthly runoff data for the period 2021-2050 under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 was simulated using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) driven by the General Circulation Models (GCMs), and the optimal ecological flow range calculated by PHABSIM for a given river section was used to determine the limited ecological curve. The operation optimization model considering both ecological profits and hydropower generation was established and solved to obtain DEOC. Compared with COC, DEOC results in a significant increase in power generation (>9%) and a reduction in ecological damage frequency without affecting the overall ecological conservation rate, especially at an ecological target of 70% and 80%, which can improve the adaptation of reservoir operation to climate change.","[Ding, Ziyu; Fang, Guohua; Wen, Xin; Tan, Qiaofeng; Liu, Zhehua; Huang, Xianfeng] Hohai Univ, Coll Water Conservancy & Hydropower Engn, Nanjing 210098, Peoples R China; [Wen, Xin; Lei, Xiaohui] China Inst Water Resources & Hydropower Res, State Key Lab Simulat & Regulat Water Cycle River, Beijing 100038, Peoples R China",njwenxin@163.com,31,3,3,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0920-4741,WATER RESOUR MANAG,Water Resour.

Although SES approaches to monitoring and evaluation are advocated in global science and policy arenas, real-world applications remain scarce. Here, we describe the first operationalization and implementation of Ostrom's influential SES framework for monitoring practice across multiple countries. Designed to inform management aimed at sustaining coral reefs and the people that depend on them, we developed our SES monitoring framework through a transdisciplinary process involving academics and practitioners with expertise in social and ecological sciences. We describe the SES monitroing framework, including how it operationalizes key insights from the SES and program evaluation literatures, and demonstrate how insights from its implementation in more than 85 communities in four countries (Fiji, Indonesia, Kenya and Madagascar) are informing decision-making at multiple levels. Responding to repeated calls for guidance on applying SES approaches to monitoring and management practice, we outline the key steps of the transdisciplinary development of the framework and lessons learnt. Therefore, our work contributes to bridging the gap between SES science and commons management practice through not only providing an SES monitoring framework that can be readily applied to coral reefs and other commons, but also through demonstrating how to operationalize SES approaches for real-world monitoring and management practice.","[Gurney, Georgina G.] James Cook Univ, Australian Res Council, Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Darling, Emily S.; McClanahan, Tim R.; Campbell, Stuart J.; Muthiga, Nyawira A.; D'agata, Stephanie; Holmes, Katherine E.] Wildlife Conservat Soc, Marine Program, Bronx, NY 10460 USA; [Darling, Emily S.] Univ Toronto, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Jupiter, Stacy D.; Mangubhai, Sangeeta; Fox, Margaret; Naisilisili, Waisea] Wildlife Conservat Soc, Melanesia Program, 11 Maafu St, Suva, Fiji; [Campbell, Stuart J.] Rare, Indonesia Program, JL Gunung Gede 1 6 Taman Kencana, Bogor 16151, W Java, Indonesia; [D'agata, Stephanie] Macquarie Univ, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Rossi, Natalia A.] Wildlife Conservat Soc, Cuba Program, Bronx, NY 10460 USA; [Lestari, Peni; Pardede, Shinta] Wildlife Conservat Soc, Indonesia Program, JL Malabar 1 11, Bogor, Indonesia",georgina.gurney@jcu.edu.au,66,24,24,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0006-3207,BIOL CONSERV,Biol.

Spatial prioritization of high quality habitat in agricultural landscapes is needed to protect grassland biodiversity. Within this context, we focused on European ground squirrel, a keystone species in steppe and salt steppe ecosystems. Using historical data and habitat field mapping, this study evaluates species distribution and site occupancy along the southern margin of the species range (Serbia) and identifies priority conservation zones in an intensively used landscape. Using gap analysis to evaluate changes in distribution over time and land protection status of the occupied area, we found that the regional species range has been constricted by 70%, and that 43% of mapped areas were outside of conservation networks. We also used a landscape structure model and multivariate analysis to identify the effects of spatial heterogeneity on occupancy. After mapping potential conservation zones with a buffer radius of 4.6 km-the scale with significant effects on occupancy-we identified 19 potential agro-ecological zones that cover the full range of mapped species habitats. The proposed agro-ecological zones differ in percentage of occupancy, which was found to increase with the overall landscape heterogeneity. This study contributes to the ongoing effort to broaden the understanding of the ecology and conservation of the European ground squirrel and the grasslands they rely on. Conservation planning should be designed to protect grasslands occupied by ground squirrels, ensure that the agricultural matrix is permeable, and to sustain or enhance landscape heterogeneity.","[Nikolic, Tijana] BioSense Inst, Dr Zorana Dindica 1, Novi Sad 21000, Serbia; [Nikolic, Tijana; Radisic, Dimitrije; Milic, Dubravka; Vujic, Ante] Univ Novi Sad, Fac Sci, Dept Biol & Ecol, Trg Dositeja Obradovica 2, Novi Sad 21000, Serbia; [Cosic, Nada] Univ Belgrade Sinisa Stankovic, Inst Biol Res, Bulevar Despota Stefana 142, Belgrade 11060, Serbia; [Diaz-Delgado, Ricardo] CSIC, Estn Biol Donana, Remote Sensing & GIS Lab LAST EBD, Avda Americo Vespucio S-N, Seville 41092, Spain; [Cirovic, Dusko] Univ Belgrade, Fac Biol, Studentski Trg 16, Belgrade 11000, Serbia",tijana.nikolic@biosense.rs,65,5,5,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0960-3115,BIODIVERS CONSERV,Biodivers.

Scat analyses have suggested a dietary overlap between AWs and EWs, raising the potential for exploitative competition, and a possible conservation threat to EWs. However, in contrast to that of the well-studied EW, the foraging ecology of AWs remains poorly characterized. Accordingly, we studied the foraging ecology of radio-collared AWs (n = 11 individuals) at two localities with varying levels of anthropogenic disturbance in the Ethiopian Highlands, the Guassa-Menz Community Conservation Area (GMCCA) and Borena-Saynt National Park (BSNP), accumulating 845 h of focal observation across 2952 feeding events. We also monitored rodent abundance and rodent trapping activity by local farmers who experience conflict with AWs. The AW diet consisted largely of rodents (22.0%), insects (24.8%), and goats and sheep (24.3%). Of the total rodents captured by farmers using local traps during peak barley production (July to November) in GMCCA, averaging 24.7 +/- 8.5 rodents/hectare/day, 81% (N = 3009) were scavenged by AWs. Further, of all the rodents consumed by AWs, most (74%) were carcasses. These results reveal complex interactions between AWs and local farmers, and highlight the scavenging niche occupied by AWs in anthropogenically altered landscapes in contrast to the active hunting exhibited by EWs in more intact habitats. While AWs cause economic damage to local farmers through livestock predation, they appear to play an important role in scavenging pest rodents among farmlands, a pattern of behaviour which likely mitigates direct and indirect competition with EWs. We suggest two routes to promote the coexistence of AWs and EWs in the Ethiopian highlands: local education efforts highlighting the complex role AWs play in highland ecosystems to reduce their persecution, and enforced protection of intact habitats to preserve habitat preferred by EWs.","[Gutema, Tariku Mekonnen; Fashing, Peter J.; Stenseth, Nils C.] Univ Oslo, Ctr Ecol & Evolutionary Synth, Dept Biosci, POB 1066, N-0316 Oslo, Norway; [Tsegaye, Diress] Univ Oslo, Dept Biosci, POB 1066, N-0316 Oslo, Norway; [Gutema, Tariku Mekonnen] Jimma Univ, Dept Nat Resources Management, POB 307, Jimma, Ethiopia; [Atickem, Anagaw] Leibniz Inst Primate Res, German Primate Ctr, Cognit Ethol Lab, Kellnerweg 4, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany; [Atickem, Anagaw; Bekele, Afework; Kasso, Mohammed; Stenseth, Nils C.] Addis Ababa Univ, Dept Zool Sci, POB 1176, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia; [Sillero-Zubiri, Claudio; Marino, Jorgelina] Univ Oxford, Zool Dept, Wildlife Conservat Res Unit, Tubney House, Tubney OX13 5QL, England; [Sillero-Zubiri, Claudio; Marino, Jorgelina] IUCN SSC Canid Specialist Grp, Oxford, England; [Venkataraman, Vivek V.] Inst Adv Study Toulouse, F-31000 Toulouse, France; [Fashing, Peter J.] Calif State Univ Fullerton, Dept Anthropol & Environm Studies Program, 800 North State Coll Blvd, Fullerton, CA 92834 USA",n.c.stenseth@ibv.uio.no,29,6,7,ROYAL SOC,LONDON,"6-9 CARLTON HOUSE TERRACE, LONDON SW1Y 5AG, ENGLAND",2054-5703,ROY SOC OPEN SCI,R.

However, few ecologists still use NCT, probably because they believe that ecological and evolutionary processes do not occur at the same pace or because they believe that the modem evolutionary synthesis (MES) explains the studied phenomena well enough. NCT is not opposed to the MES. However, NCT proponents argue that because all organisms undergo environmental modifications, they can alter the selection pressures that act on themselves and other species. In this case, adaptation is conceived as a two-way process in which organisms and the environment act upon one another. Therefore, this article aims to present a brief introduction of NCT, arguing and exemplifying its applicability in ecological studies and conservation strategies.

Despite this, coasts - as a coherent ecological unit - have been poorly included in conservation plans, largely because they are inadequately delineated. There are usually gaps and overlaps at the edges of the separate terrestrial-, estuarine- and marine-realm maps, and often no clarity on which specific coastal boundary (e.g., high-water mark) was used, other than vaguely, 'the coastline'. This particularly compromises conservation and management of ecotonal, intertidal ecosystems along realm-map seams because they are poorly defined and mapped. Therefore, a key step in advancing coastal conservation, assessment, planning and management is to generate a fine-scale ecosystem-type map that is seamless across realms. We undertook this for South Africa, aiming to delineate the ecotone into ecologically meaningful zones comprising structurally and functionally appropriate ecosystem types. We defined and mapped (at < 1:3000) the 'seashore' as the land-sea interface between the dune scrub-thicket break and the back of the surf zone. The seashore is divided at the dune base into a landward `backshore' and seaward 'shore', with the inherent dynamic variability included in the boundary delineation and constituent ecosystem types. Estuaries were also embedded into the map. Finally, we created rules for including adjacent terrestrial and marine ecosystem types in an ecologically determined coastal zone. We describe what tools this seashore integration and coastal delineation has unlocked, and how this places South Africa in a strong position to manage and conserve its coast.","[Harris, Linda R.; Holness, Stephen] Nelson Mandela Univ, Inst Coastal & Marine Res, Dept Zool, POB 77000, ZA-6031 Port Elizabeth, South Africa; [Bessinger, Martel; Luck-Vogel, Melanie] Univ Stellenbosch, Dept Geog & Environm Studies, ZA-7602 Stellenbosch, South Africa; [Bessinger, Martel; Dayaram, Anisha; Sink, Kerry J.; Skowno, Andrew L.] Kirstenbosch Res Ctr, South African Natl Biodivers Inst, Private Bag X7, ZA-7735 Claremont, South Africa; [Kirkman, Stephen; Pfaff, Maya] Dept Environm Affairs, Oceans & Coastal Res, POB 52126, ZA-8000 Cape Town, South Africa; [Livingstone, Tamsyn-Claire] Ezemvelo KZNWildlife, POB 13069, ZA-3202 Cascades, South Africa; [Lombard, Amanda T.; Sink, Kerry J.; Van Niekerk, Lara] Nelson Mandela Univ, Inst Coastal & Marine Res, POB 77000, ZA-6031 Port Elizabeth, South Africa; [Luck-Vogel, Melanie; Van Niekerk, Lara] CSIR, POB 320, Stellenbosch, South Africa; [Pfaff, Maya; Skowno, Andrew L.] Univ Cape Town, Dept Biol Sci, ZA-8000 Cape Town, South Africa",harris.linda.r@gmail.com,53,10,10,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0006-3207,BIOL CONSERV,Biol.

Strategic conservation planning, and more recently marine spatial planning (MSP) are among the most promising management tools to operationalize and enforce marine conservation. As yet, climate change is seldom incorporated into these plans, potentially curtailing the effectiveness of designated conservation areas under novel environmental conditions. Reliable assessment of current and future climate change threats requires the ability to map climate-driven eco-evolutionary changes and the identification of vulnerable and resistant populations. Here we explore the heretofore largely unrecognized value of information gained from physiological, ecological and evolutionary studies to MSP under ongoing climate change. For example, we explore how climate threats do not necessarily follow latitudinal gradients, such that both risk hotspots and refugia occur in mosaic distributions along species ranges - patterns that may be undetectable without knowledge of biological vulnerabilities at regional and local scales. Because co-occurring species can exhibit markedly different vulnerabilities to the same environmental changes, making ecological predictions requires, when possible, measuring the fundamental niches of key species (e.g., with the use of thermotolerance experiments). Forecasting also requires development of tools to identify the likelihood of community-level thresholds or tipping points (e.g., with the use of near-real world mesocosms), and assessment of the potential of populations for adaptation (e.g., with common garden experiments). Such research will facilitate better predictive models for the fate of populations, species, ecosystems and their functions. Ultimately, unfolding the complexity of the processes underlying climate change impacts will facilitate quantifying and reducing uncertainty in spatial planning decision processes and will enable the development of practical tools to validate adaptive conservation strategies.

Protection improves with increasing knowledge of the biology and ecology of these species. However, species numbers rapidly increase with the ongoing description of cryptic species, resulting in a lack of ecological knowledge for each of these species. We studied the nutritional ecology of three cryptic bat species of the Myotis mystacinus group using stable isotope analysis and molecular fecal analysis. Inter- and intraspecific variations were compared by calculating the isotopic and dietary niches for each species. We hypothesized (a) that all three species are generalists, but (b) that M. mystacinus and Myotis brandtii are more similar to each other than to Myotis alcathoe. Third we assumed that the occupied niches are intraspecifically more similar than interspecifically. We could show that the members of the M. mystacinus group differ in their nutritional ecology. Our data suggest that M. alcathoe is the most specialized species of the group, occupying a more distinct ecological niche compared to the other two species. Interestingly, the dietary and isotopic niche overlap was higher interspecifically than intraspecifically. Furthermore, considering our findings and those from other studies we illustrate implications for the conservation of these cryptic species.","[Roswag, Anna; Becker, Nina I.; Encarnacao, Jorge A.] Justus Liebig Univ Giessen, Dept Anim Ecol & Systemat, Mammalian Ecol Grp, Giessen, Germany; [Becker, Nina I.; Encarnacao, Jorge A.] Inatu Re, Inst Appl Anim Ecol & Ecoinformat, Lollar, Germany; [Drangusch, Robert; Kuhring, Kathleen] Workgrp Bat Conservat Saxony Anhalt eV, Stolberg, Germany; [Ohlendorf, Bernd] Biospharenreservat Karstlandschaft Sudharz, Landesreferenzstelle Fledermausschutz Sachsen Anh, Sudharz, Germany",j.encarnacao@bio.uni-giessen.de,72,3,3,SPRINGER JAPAN KK,TOKYO,"CHIYODA FIRST BLDG EAST, 3-8-1 NISHI-KANDA, CHIYODA-KU, TOKYO, 101-0065, JAPAN",1438-3896,POPUL ECOL,Popul.

The Pacific goliath grouper (PGG; Epinephelus quinquefasciatus), the largest reef fish inhabiting the tropical Eastern Pacific region, is suspected to be subject to high levels of exploitation, but scarce information exists on their population status and the species remains classed as Data Deficient according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List. This study documents for the first time the threats to the PGG along the Colombian Pacific coast, where one of the few active fisheries for this species persists. Reconstructed landings of groupers and traditional ecological knowledge, gathered throughout several coastal villages, were used to obtain a historical and contemporary overview of the PGG status in Colombia. Over the past 20years grouper landings in the Colombian Pacific have been around 200 tons per year. Landings of PGG have averaged similar to 35 tons per year and are now close to matching those of the historically most landed grouper on this coast, the rooster hind (Hyporthodus acanthistius). The current small-scale fishery for PGG focuses on immature small individuals, with most taken from the extensive southern mangroves. Until recently fishers have captured PGG exclusively with handlines, but new fishing practices (spearfishing) and markets commanding higher prices for small individuals are increasing the extinction risk for the PGG. The exploitation of PGG in the Colombian Pacific may not be as severe as in other countries where severe population declines are suspected (e.g. Mexico). Low coastal human population density and the presence of relatively intact mangroves, essential habitat for juvenile fishes, contribute to the persistence of PGG populations throughout the Colombian Pacific. National and regional conservation and management measures should identify and protect mangrove nurseries and offshore spawning aggregation sites. Well-enforced protected nurseries and spawning aggregation sites will then protect juvenile and adult PGG, improving the sustainability of this fishery.","[Castellanos-Galindo, Gustavo A.; Baos E, Rodrigo A.; Zapata, Luis A.] World Wildlife Fund WWF Colombia, Programa Marino Costero, Carrera 35 4 A 25, Cali, Colombia; [Castellanos-Galindo, Gustavo A.; Chong-Montenegro, Carolina; Tompkins, Paul] Leibniz Ctr Trop Marine Res ZMT, Bremen, Germany; [Graham, Rachel T.] MarAlliance, San Pedro, Belize; [Craig, Matthew] Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, NOAA, Southwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, La Jolla, CA 92038 USA",gustavoa80@yahoo.com,41,6,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1052-7613,AQUAT CONSERV,Aquat.

When actual application of scientific principles is confronted with public appreciation and engagement on the ground, the perception per se of-and reaction to-the scientific discourse and technical arguments regarding conservation value(s) of designated areas, it often turns into a critique by local communities of the preponderant role of experts and the dominance of a western scientific worldview in the ecological modernization era. In this paper, we develop the formalism-and use variations-of a multiplicative model of conservation value, involving concepts that are central to the IPBES decomposition of values into interacting meanings: principles and preferences. Technically, overall valuation after a suite of conservation criteria of an exemplary designated site, i.e. the Natura 2000 Kalloni Gulf, Greece, is decomposed into the product of two factors, technical score and appreciation, as perceived by a series of local influential stakeholder groups. We use a multi-criteria valuation profile adopted and promoted by scientific experts as reference to which respective valuations of stakeholder groups are contrasted. The study refers to a case where a two decade-long fierce social conflict drove to stagnation the implementation process. Divergence(s) in scoring and appreciation of conservation criteria between scientific experts versus local stakeholder groups are measured using our models variables and classic decomposition analysis techniques. Our model(s) treat the following problems: (1) the relative effects of singular conservation criteria when only one conservation criterion in one site is considered; (2) the relative effects of multiple conservation criteria when applied in one site. A narrative story is attempted regarding discursive conflicts between social groups in the studied case: (1) a pattern of mistrust of the public against scientific discourse on conservation planning: scientists are perceived just as 'another stakeholder group' promoting their own pro-conservation agenda; (2) a NIMBY-like reaction based on individuals' property-defence discourse; and, (3) the by-effects of poor governance in downscaling decision-making from centralized to regional/local level.","[Troumbis, Andreas Y.; Vasios, Georgios K.] Univ Aegean, Sch Environm, Biodivers Conservat Lab, Mitilini, Greece; [Vasios, Georgios K.] Univ Aegean, Sch Environm, Dept Food Sci & Nutr, Mitilini, Greece; [Hatziantoniou, Maria N.] Univ Aegean, Sch Environm, Sect Environm Social Sci, Dept Environm Studies, Mitilini, Greece",atro@aegean.gr; vasios@aegean.gr; mhatz@env.aegean.gr,69,1,1,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0960-3115,BIODIVERS CONSERV,Biodivers.

Southern geladas (Theropithecus gelada obscurus) are endemic subspecies of gelada that inhabit in north central Ethiopian Highlands. During the 18 months of the first intensive study period, we examined the feeding ecology of southern geladas and their dietary responses to seasonal variations in an Afroalpine ecosystem, Borena Sayint National Park, an important site for the conservation of biodiversity in the north central Ethiopia. We collected monthly diet data from a band of southern geladas using instantaneous scan sampling method, and monthly temporal changes in green graminoid leaves and/or forb availability data using visual inspection from the randomly selected plots. The overall diet of southern geladas at Keywasha consisted of 54.4% graminoid leaves, 9.4% graminoid underground, 9.0% graminoid seeds, 17.0% forb leaves, 7.4% forb underground and 1.5% invertebrates. The diet of geladas exhibited wide variability across months. Southern geladas spent significantly more time feeding on the graminoid leaves, and significantly less time on the graminoid and forb underground diet items during the wet season than the dry season. Graminoid leaf consumption was significantly positively correlated with monthly increment of green graminoid leaf availability. By contrast, there was a significant increase in the consumption of graminoid underground when monthly green graminoid leaf availability becomes low. The result shows that southern geladas adapt seasonal shifts in their diet consumption as staple foods changed temporally in the Ethiopian Afroalpine ecosystem. Our findings contribute to a better understanding of the dietary flexibility of primates in response to local environment conditions that may shape primate ecology and evolution.","[Kifle, Zewdu] Bahir Dar Univ, Dept Biol, Bahir Dar, Ethiopia; [Kifle, Zewdu; Bekele, Afework] Addis Ababa Univ, Dept Zool Sci, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia",zewdu96@yahoo.com,52,0,0,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",,GLOB ECOL CONSERV,Glob.

Following the 2019-2020 Australian megafires, we estimated population losses and recovery in fire-affected fauna, to inform conservation status assessments and management. Location Temperate and subtropical Australia. Time period 2019-2030 and beyond. Major taxa Australian terrestrial and freshwater vertebrates; one invertebrate group. Methods From > 1,050 fire-affected taxa, we selected 173 whose distributions substantially overlapped the fire extent. We estimated the proportion of each taxon's distribution affected by fires, using fire severity and aquatic impact mapping, and new distribution mapping. Using expert elicitation informed by evidence of responses to previous wildfires, we estimated local population responses to fires of varying severity. We combined the spatial and elicitation data to estimate overall population loss and recovery trajectories, and thus indicate potential eligibility for listing as threatened, or uplisting, under Australian legislation. Results We estimate that the 2019-2020 Australian megafires caused, or contributed to, population declines that make 70-82 taxa eligible for listing as threatened; and another 21-27 taxa eligible for uplisting. If so-listed, this represents a 22-26% increase in Australian statutory lists of threatened terrestrial and freshwater vertebrates and spiny crayfish, and uplisting for 8-10% of threatened taxa. Such changes would cause an abrupt worsening of underlying trajectories in vertebrates, as measured by Red List Indices. We predict that 54-88% of 173 assessed taxa will not recover to pre-fire population size within 10 years/three generations. Main conclusions We suggest the 2019-2020 Australian megafires have worsened the conservation prospects for many species. Of the 91 taxa recommended for listing/uplisting consideration, 84 are now under formal review through national processes. Improving predictions about taxon vulnerability with empirical data on population responses, reducing the likelihood of future catastrophic events and mitigating their impacts on biodiversity, are critical.","[Legge, Sarah; Woinarski, John C.

For the scientific community, the pandemic has called upon investigators to continue work in novel ways, curtailing field and lab research. However, this unprecedented situation also offers an opportunity for researchers to optimize and further develop available field methods. Camera traps are one example of a tool used in science to answer questions about wildlife ecology, conservation, and management. Camera traps have long battery lives, lasting more than a year in certain cases, and photo storage capacity, with some models capable of wirelessly transmitting images from the field. This allows researchers to deploy cameras without having to check them for up to a year or more, making them an ideal field research tool during restrictions on in-person research activities such as COVID-19 lockdowns. As technological advances allow cameras to collect increasingly greater numbers of photos and videos, the analysis techniques for large amounts of data are evolving. Here, we describe the most common research questions suitable for camera trap studies and their importance for biodiversity conservation. As COVID-19 continues to affect how people interact with the natural environment, we discuss novel questions for which camera traps can provide insights on. We conclude by summarizing the results of a systematic review of camera trap studies, providing data on target taxa, geographic distribution, publication rate, and publication venues to help researchers planning to use camera traps in response to the current changes in human activity.","[Blount, J.

Consequently, feral species are playing an increasingly important role in ecological community dynamics. Artificially selected life-history traits of wild but once domesticated species can elicit population dynamics that differ substantially from that of native species. Yet, we continue to lag in our understanding of the ecology and evolution of feral species with direct consequences to resource management and biodiversity conservation. In part, this is because basic and applied research into the ecology of feral wildlife is fraught with social and political challenges unique to science. Feral populations of companion animals or livestock, especially, can evoke strong emotional reactions among advocacy groups, particularly around issues of animal welfare and management policy. Managers tasked with controlling feral populations are often bound by social license, including legislative restrictions, incomparable to that of other wildlife, and harassment or litigation of researchers and managers is not uncommon. Further, research and management of feral species is often delegated to agricultural instead of wildlife government agencies with clear differences in mandate, staff education, and training. Using examples primarily from feral horses in North America, we show how scientists conducting research independent of the management process can find themselves placed between managers, advocates, and opponents of feral species, implicitly tasked with satisfying multiple and often contradictory interests of stakeholders, sometimes with direct and litigious interference. These barriers are exacerbated by inter-disciplinary tendencies to dismiss the importance of basic and applied ecological research into feral species, despite its relevance to sound decision-making. Feral species therefore possess politically and biologically facilitated asymmetries that favor persistence, growth, and expansion relative to native wildlife, while the timely study of these characteristics in nature continues to suffer from ideological opposition.

However, robust assessments of CBCRM program outcomes are relatively scarce. This study uses a multidisciplinary, systems approach to assess the ecological and social dimensions of success of an internationally acclaimed CBCRM program. This program, located in one of the largest protected areas in the Peruvian Amazon (Pacaya-Samiria National Reserve), strives for the sustainable harvest and trade of a turtle species (Podocnemis unifilis). We used mixed methods analysis, including interviews and population viability modeling, to understand three elements: how local perceptions of changes in the managed population compare to changes inferred by ecological analyses, the indicators stakeholders use to measure success, and the barriers to long-term program success and social-ecological system sustainability. We find that stakeholders perceive a growth trend in the managed turtle population, but this perception may diverge from our ecological understanding of the system under current management. Population viability analyses with a 1:1 sex ratio suggested population size will decline under two of three management scenarios (different degrees of harvest). Yet this and similar studies are plagued by a lack of species- and site-specific population parameters that could improve understanding of the system. Significant vulnerabilities exist for system sustainability, notably the recent decrease in foreign demand for the traded resource. Identifying a sustainable species-specific harvest rate, developing locally-grounded ecological and social indicators, and focusing on data-driven adaptive management will facilitate the identification of key leverage points for future management interventions.","[Rivera, Christian J.] Columbia Univ, Dept Ecol Evolut & Environm Biol, 10th Floor Schermerhorn Ext,1200 Amsterdam Ave, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Rivera, Christian J.; Macey, Suzanne K.; Blair, Mary E.; Sterling, Eleanor J.] Amer Museum Nat Hist, Ctr Biodivers & Conservat, Cent Pk West,79th St, New York, NY 10024 USA; [Rivera, Christian J.] Univ Florida, Inst Food & Agr Sci, Dept Wildlife Ecol & Conservat, 110 Newins Ziegler Hall,POB 110430, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA",cjrivera@alumni.princeton.edu,48,1,1,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0364-152X,ENVIRON MANAGE,Environ.

Conflicts arise over land ownership, use, and access. Political ecologists have paid extensive attention to protected areas, especially in relation to power, rights, and marginalized peoples. This article draws on political ecology to examine a new proposed national park in the context of post-communism and neoliberalization in Romania. Using mixed-methods (semi-structured interviews, questionnaires, and participant observation), this research investigates conservation narratives as articulated by different actors (environmental non-governmental organizations, local decision-makers, and local community members) with various levels of involvement in the proposed national park. Three chief narratives can be observed pertaining to tourism, restrictions, and deforestation. These narratives are embedded in the history and socio-economic context of the area, but also reveal the agendas of different actors regarding landscape values. Assessing these narratives, this research reveals how actors position themselves and the points of contention among the different actors in the brewing conflict that the national park represents.","[Aastrup, Marie Louise] Mem Univ Newfoundland, Dept Geog, St John, NF, Canada",mlaastrup@mun.ca,72,2,2,UNIV ARIZONA LIBRARIES,TUCSON,"UNIV ARIZONA LIBRARIES, TUCSON, AZ 85721 USA",1073-0451,J POLIT ECOL,J.

Thus, understanding the foraging ecology of threatened carnivores is important for conservation planning. We explore the summer diet of the Himalayan wolf, and of sympatric carnivores, based on the analysis of 257 field collected and genetically confirmed scat samples collected across three study areas in the Himalayas of Nepal (Humla, Dolpa, and Kanchenjunga Conservation Area) and two study areas on the Tibetan Plateau of China (Zhaqing and Namsai Township). We compared the prey species consumed to the relative availability of wild and domestic prey species. Himalayan wolves tend to select wild over domestic prey, smaller (e.g. Tibetan gazelle, Procapra picticaudata) over larger sized wild ungulates (e.g. White-lipped deer, Cervus albirostris), and plains-dwelling (Tibetan gazelle) over cliff-dwelling ungulates (naur, Pseudois nayaur). Tibetan gazelle was consistently selected for by the Himalayan wolf and smaller mammals such as Himalayan marmot (Marmota himalayana), woolly hare (Lepus oiostolus) and pikas (Ochotona spp.) are important supplementary food resources. Himalayan wolves avoided livestock which showed a seasonal high abundance, that exceeded many-fold the abundance of wild prey species during the summer study period. Given this seasonally high livestock abundance, depredation by Himalayan wolves is inevitable and a major conservation concern. Habitat encroachment and depletion of wild prey populations are important drivers of this conflict. But we found that livestock was avoided when wild prey was available, a finding that can direct conservation. We conclude that the protection of Himalayan wolves, and other sympatric carnivores can be enhanced by a) securing healthy wild prey populations (ungulates and small mammals) through setting aside wildlife habitat refuges, and b) more sustainable livestock herding including reduced livestock loads and improved herding practices and protection.

To address these challenges, we used an effective set of time- and cost-efficient methods including interview-based surveys assisted by Google earth 3D maps to document the distributional range of 32 native animal taxa in the biodiverse but difficult to access Gaoligong Mountains (GLGMS), located on the northern Sino-Myanmar Border. Five threatened flagship species, including the black snub-nosed monkey (Rhinopithecus strykeri), the Skywalker hoolock gibbon (Hoolock tianxing), Shortridge's langur (Trachypithecus shortridgei), Sclater's monal (Lophophorus sclateri) and the Mishmi takin (Budorcas taxicolor) were selected for intensive surveys and used as surrogate taxa to study community biodiversity. Field surveys of each species were conducted to determine their presence/absence and to confirm the reliability of species distribution data obtained from interview-based surveys. Multicriteria Decision Analyses were used along with data on habitat suitability (MAXENT) to prioritize transboundary conservation areas. Our results indicate that approximately 83.4% (10,398.7 km(2)) of the remaining habitat with high biodiversity conservation value in the GLGMs is unprotected. This includes six large zones located along the northern Sino-Myanmar border, separated by rivers and human settlements. These areas should be designated as a transboundary World Nature Heritage Site, national parks, or wildlife sanctuaries. This study presents a reliable, rapid and integrative method for developing informed policies for conservation prioritization in data poor areas, which can be applied successfully to assess conservation priorities in other mountainous regions where obtaining data on biodiversity is difficult.

Here, we provide a cumulative measure of human modification of terrestrial lands based on modeling the physical extents of 13 anthropogenic stressors and their estimated impacts using spatially explicit global datasets with a median year of 2016. We quantified the degree of land modification and the amount and spatial configuration of low modified lands (i.e., natural areas relatively free from human alteration) across all ecoregions and biomes. We identified that fewer unmodified lands remain than previously reported and that most of the world is in a state of intermediate modification, with 52% of ecoregions classified as moderately modified. Given that these moderately modified ecoregions fall within critical land use thresholds, we propose that they warrant elevated attention and require proactive spatial planning to maintain biodiversity and ecosystem function before important environmental values are lost.","[Kennedy, Christina M.; Oakleaf, James R.; Baruch-Mordo, Sharon; Kiesecker, Joseph] Nature Conservancy, Global Lands Program, Ft Collins, CO 80526 USA; [Theobald, David M.] Conservat Sci Partners, Ft Collins, CO USA",ckennedy@tnc.org,84,118,120,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1354-1013,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

For instance, the degree of fear perceived by fishes targeted by fisheries is frequently higher in unprotected marine areas than in areas where some protection is provided. We systematically reviewed the literature on how fear, which we define as variation in escape behavior, was quantified in reef fishes, In the past 25 years, a total of 33 studies were identified, many of which were published within the last five years and nearly 40% of those (n = 13) focused on Indo-Pacific reefs, showing that there are still many geographical gaps. While eleven escape metrics were identified to evaluate fish escape, flight initiation distance (FID) was the most commonly employed (n = 23). FID was used to study different questions of applied and theoretical ecology, which involved 14 reef fish families. We also used a formal meta-analysis to investigate the effects of fishing by comparing FID inside and outside marine protected areas. Fishes outside MPAs had increased FID compared to those inside MPAs. The Labridae family had a significantly higher effect sizes than Acanthuridae and Epinephelidae, suggesting that fishes in this family may be indicators of effective MPAs using FID. We conclude that protocols aimed to quantify fear in fishes, which provide accurate assessments of fishing effects on fish escape behavior, will help gauge the compliance of marine protected areas.","[Nunes, Jose Anchieta C.

However, advanced computational skills and specialized knowledge have been normally required to extract forest information from LiDAR. The development of accessible tools for 3D forest characterization can facilitate rapid assessment by stakeholders lacking a remote sensing background, thus fostering the practical use of LiDAR datasets in forest ecology and conservation. This paper introduces the treetop application, an open-source web-based and R package LiDAR analysis tool for extracting forest structural information at the tree level, including cutting-edge analyses of properties related to forest ecology and management. We provide case studies of how treetop can be used for different ecological applications, within various forest ecosystems. Specifically, treetop was employed to assess post-hurricane disturbance in natural temperate forests, forest homogeneity in industrial forest plantations and the spatial distribution of individual trees in a tropical forest. treetop simplifies the extraction of relevant forest information for forest ecologists and conservationists who may use the tool to easily visualize tree positions and sizes, conduct complex analyses and download results including individual tree lists and figures summarizing forest structural properties. Through this open-source approach, treetop can foster the practical use of LiDAR data among forest conservation and management stakeholders and help ecological researchers to further understand the relationships between forest structure and function.","[Silva, Carlos Alberto] Univ Florida, Forest Biometr & Remote Sensing Lab, Silva Lab, Sch Forest Fisheries & Geomat Sci, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Hudak, Andrew T.] US Forest Serv, USDA, Rocky Mt Res Stn, Moscow, ID USA; [Vierling, Lee A.] Univ Idaho, Coll Nat Resources, Dept Nat Resources & Soc, Moscow, ID USA; [Valbuena, Ruben] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Umea, Sweden; [Cardil, Adrian] Univ Lleida, Dept Agr & Forest Engn, Lleida, Spain; [Cardil, Adrian] Tecnosylva, Parque Tecnol Leon, Leon, Spain; [Mohan, Midhun] Univ Calif UC Berkeley, Dept Geog, Berkeley, CA USA; [Alves Almeida, Danilo Roberti] Univ Sao Paulo, Dept Forest Sci, Luiz de Queiroz Coll Agr USP ESALQ, Piracicaba, Brazil; [Broadbent, Eben N.] Univ Florida, Spatial Ecol & Conservat Lab, Sch Forest Fisheries & Geomat Sci, Gainesville, FL USA; [Zambrano, Angelica M.

In contrast to the overexploited lowlands, the highlands of north-eastern Algeria are hotspots of freshwater biodiversity and the last refugia to micro-endemics, North African endemics, and Eurosiberian relicts. The mayflies of relict mountain streams of north-eastern Algeria were investigated and 20 species or taxa in five families were recorded. Two species of the genus Habrophlebia and one species of Centroptilum are new to science, whereas two Rhithrogena species are new to Algeria, including the Numidian endemic Rhithrogena sartorii. Co-inertia analysis suggested a highly significant co-structure between mayfly assemblages and habitats defined by altitude, flow velocity, bed width, water depth, and water conductivity. In addition, a Poisson generalized linear model indicated a strong positive relationship between species richness and water depth and a weaker negative one with bed width (stream size). The results are congruent with the hypothesis that habitat provides the templet that drives mayfly communities, and they support the use of mayflies as bioindicators in the implementation of monitoring schemes to assess the ecological integrity of Maghrebian freshwater biodiversity hotspots.

Globally, habitat loss, fragmentation and degradation due to increases in agricultural activities and urban development have reduced or altered geographically isolated wetlands, thus reducing biodiversity. The objective of this study was to assess the relative ecological function and integrity of natural ponds, excavated ponds and stormwater basins in the New Jersey Pinelands, located in the northeastern United States by comparing hydrologic conditions, water quality, pesticide concentrations (water, sediment and tissue) and wetland assemblages including amphibians. Twenty-four wetlands were selected based on surrounding land-use and sampled for a variety of abiotic and biotic variables. Abiotic and biotic wetland variables were similar between natural and excavated ponds, with notable differences between the ponds and stormwater basins. Natural and excavated ponds displayed characteristic Pinelands water quality (low pH, high organic carbon, and low pesticide concentrations), exhibited high ecological integrity and supported native ampbibians. Stormwater basins and degraded ponds surrounded by altered land-use exhibited degraded water quality (high pH, high pesticide concentrations) and were dominated by non-native and introduced plants and amphibians. Results from this study can broadly inform resource conservation strategies for amphibians and other communities with a diverse range of habitat requirements, particularly in areas where conservation and development are competing priorities. To conserve biodiversity in changing landscapes, wetlands with similar functionality and land-use characteristics need to be identified and managed to preserve water quality for species of conservation concern.","[Smalling, Kelly L.; Breitmeyer, Sara E.; Cohl, Jonathan A.; Romanok, Kristin M.] US Geol Survey, New Jersey Water Sci Ctr, Lawrenceville, NJ 08648 USA; [Bunnell, John F.; Laidig, Kim J.; Burritt, Patrick M.; Sobel, Marilyn C.] New Jersey Pinelands Commiss, Pemberton, NJ 08068 USA; [Hladik, Michelle L.] US Geol Survey, Calif Water Sci Ctr, Sacramento, CA 95819 USA; [Bradley, Paul M.] US Geol Survey, South Atlantic Water Sci Ctr, Columbia, SC 29210 USA",ksmall@usgs.gov,100,0,0,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",,GLOB ECOL CONSERV,Glob.

Observation of repeated trait combinations among species confronting similar environmental conditions suggest that adaptive trait combinations are constrained by functional tradeoffs within or across niche dimensions. In an earlier study, we assembled a high-resolution database of functional traits for 134 lizard species to explore ecological diversification in relation to five fundamental niche dimensions. Here we expand and further examine multivariate relationships in that dataset to assess the relative influence of niche dimensions on the distribution of species in 6-dimensional niche space and how these may deviate from distributions generated from null models. We then analyzed a dataset with lower functional-trait resolution for 1023 lizard species that was compiled from our dataset and a published database, representing most of the extant families and environmental conditions occupied by lizards globally. Ordinations from multivariate analysis were compared with null models to assess how ecological and historical factors have resulted in the conservation, divergence or convergence of lizard niches. Results Lizard species clustered within a functional niche volume influenced mostly by functional traits associated with diet, activity, and habitat/substrate. Consistent patterns of trait combinations within and among niche dimensions yielded 24 functional groups that occupied a total niche space significantly smaller than plausible spaces projected by null models. Null model tests indicated that several functional groups are strongly constrained by phylogeny, such as nocturnality in the Gekkota and the secondarily acquired sit-and-wait foraging strategy in Iguania. Most of the widely distributed and species-rich families contained multiple functional groups thereby contributing to high incidence of niche convergence. Conclusions Comparison of empirical patterns with those generated by null models suggests that ecological filters promote limited sets of trait combinations, especially where similar conditions occur, reflecting both niche convergence and conservatism. Widespread patterns of niche convergence following ancestral niche diversification support the idea that lizard niches are defined by trait-function relationships and interactions with environment that are, to some degree, predictable and independent of phylogeny.","[Pelegrin, Nicolas] Univ Nacl Cordoba, Inst Div Ecol Anim, Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn CONICET, Ctr Zool Aplicada,Fac Ciencias Exactas,Fis & Nat, Rondeau 798, Cordoba, Argentina; [Winemiller, Kirk O.] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Ecol & Conservat Biol, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Vitt, Laurie J.] Univ Oklahoma, Sam Noble Museum, Norman, OK 73072 USA; [Vitt, Laurie J.] Univ Oklahoma, Dept Biol, Norman, OK 73072 USA; [Fitzgerald, Daniel B.] Eastern Ecol Sci Ctr, US Geol Survey, Kearneysville, WV 25430 USA; [Pianka, Eric R.] Univ Texas Austin, Dept Integrat Biol, Austin, TX 78712 USA",pelegrin.nicolas@gmail.com,63,1,1,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",,BMC ECOL EVOL,BMC Ecol.

In this paper, we theoretically and empirically explore a model of short-term area-based conservation that prioritizes adaptive co-management: temporary areas closed to fishing, designed by the fishers they affect, approved by the government, and adapted every 5 years. In this model, no-take zones are adapted through learning and trust-building between fishers and government fisheries scientists. We use integrated social-ecological theory and a case study of a network of such fisheries closures (fishing refugia) in northwest Mexico to hypothesize a feedback loop between trust, design, and ecological outcomes. We argue that, with temporary and adaptive area-based management, social and ecological outcomes can be mutually reinforcing as long as initial designs are ecologically good enough and supported in the social-ecological context. This type of adaptive management also has the potential to adapt to climate change and other social-ecological changes. This feedback loop also predicts the dangerous possibility that low trust among stakeholders may lead to poor design, lack of ecological benefits, eroding confidence in the tool's capacity, shrinking size, and even lower likelihood of social-ecological benefits. In our case, however, this did not occur, despite poor ecological design of some areas, likely due to buffering by social network effects and alternative benefits. We discuss both the potential and the danger of temporary area-based conservation measures as a learning tool for adaptive co-management and commoning.","[Quintana, Anastasia C.

The pace of environmental degradation supports immediate and measurable action. However, best practices for adaptive governance and building resilient social-ecological systems call for more deliberate efforts and participatory processes, which can be slow. We explore conflicts between urgency and deliberateness and the potential for their reconciliation through a case study of the challenges of conserving native rangelands in North America's Northern Great Plains, an ecoregion targeted for global conservation initiatives. This region is undergoing a significant social-ecological transition, which underscores a need to rethink conservation strategies in light of the social-ecological system dynamics and potential future trajectories. Based on a structured narrative literature review process and iterative engagement with key regional stakeholders, we identify three interrelated factors critical to the system's future outcomes that illustrate system complexity as well as trade-offs between urgent and deliberate action and unilateral and multilateral approaches to conservation: (1) influences of land management on biodiversity, (2) economic restructuring and shifting land use priorities, and (3) changing climate and disturbance regimes. We identify key gaps in the literature for each factor and across the factors-an effort that informs our call for research and practice agendas that address uncertainty and complexity at regional scales through more inclusive and future-oriented approaches.","[Epstein, Kathleen; Roemer, Kelli; Wendt, John A.

However, various threats including habitat loss, climate change and poaching may have already but unknowingly elevated other Korean reptiles to threatened statuses. To help resource managers in developing conservation programs, we provide a summary of the literature on threats to Korean squamates, a national recommended threat status, and species accounts focused on Korean populations.

The theory addresses some of the most intransigent environmental and cultural trends of our time - the ongoing decline of biodiversity and cultural diversity of First Nations. Here we reflect on OCBILs, the origins of the theory, and its principal hypotheses in biological, anthropological and conservation applications. The discovery that threatened plant species are concentrated in the Southwest Australian Floristic Region (SWAFR) on infertile, phosphorous-impoverished uplands within 500 km of the coast formed the foundational framework for OCBIL theory and led to the development of testable hypotheses that a growing literature is addressing. Currently, OCBILs are recognized in 15 Global Biodiversity Hotspots and eight other regions. The SWAFR, Greater Cape Floristic Region of South Africa and South America's campos rupestres (montane grasslands) are those regions that have most comprehensively been investigated in the context of OCBIL theory.

However, global reviews of research statuses and trends in the ecological uses of various surrogate approaches in ecosystem conservation are relatively scarce. Here, to fill identified knowledge gaps, we comparatively analyze the research hotspots and trends of five surrogate approaches (i.e., keystone, flagship, umbrella, indicator, and focal species) in vertebrates based on research publications from 1962 to 2019. We found that surrogate species have increased focus since the 1990s. The five individual surrogate approaches showed clear differences in terms of scientific outputs and focal themes, which could be attributed to country/territory and journal preferences. We also found that research activities were mainly conducted in terrestrial ecosystems with mammals and birds, while freshwater species were disproportionately considered relative to the threats they face. In addition, we found that the focal themes changed from pollution monitoring to climate change and conservation strategy. Our study showed that species distribution model, protected areas and habitat selection are possible hotspots of future research using surrogate approaches under the consistent effects of climate change and habitat fragmentation. This study highlights the different uses of individual surrogate approaches and potential imbalances in conservation efforts among ecosystems and taxa, providing a reference for conservation management.

This is the case of the Andean condor (Vultur gryphus) in South America. Scientific information on this species has increased steeply in the last years, but their population declines continue. Here, we review and analyze the scientific information available about Andean condors ecology with implications for its conservation. We also evaluate published and unpublished information about the different threats affecting their populations. Finally, we propose conservation actions based on acquired scientific knowledge, which should be of help for conservation managers and policy makers. The increase in scientific information on this species was mainly focused on subject areas as key habitats for roosting and breeding, food sources, intra and interspecific interaction, human-condor relationships, movement ecology, genetic composition, and health information. Worryingly, good demographic information is still lacking (e.g., population density, breeding success, age and sex-specific survival rates) which prevents the assessment of the population viability. The most important threats affecting condor populations that require urgent actions are poisoning with pesticides and lead contamination. Illegal shooting, impacts produced by human infrastructure and cultural threats are other threats affecting this species. There is not much scientific information on the potential effects of veterinary drugs ingestion, impacts of carnivore traps, pathogen microorganisms and disturbances produced by tourism or climbing activities. Importantly, the actual population impacts of most of the mentioned threats are still unknown. Although some basic ecological studies are still needed (e.g., demography), conservation policies should incorporate scientific knowledge acquired in the last years to produce better results and reverse population declines for this species.","[Plaza, Pablo, I; Lambertucci, Sergio A.] Univ Nacl Comahue, INIBIOMA CONICET, Grp Invest Biol Conservac, Quintral 1250,R8400FRF, San Carlos De Bariloche, Rio Negro, Argentina",plazapablo@comahue-conicet.gob.ar,156,9,9,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0006-3207,BIOL CONSERV,Biol.

Counterfactuals are possible alternative system trajectories in the absence of an intervention. Comparing observed outcomes against the chosen counterfactual allows the impact (change attributable to the intervention) to be determined. Because counterfactuals by definition never occur, they must be estimated. Sometimes, there may be many plausible counterfactuals, including various drivers of biodiversity change and defined on a range of spatial or temporal scales. Here, we posit that, by definition, conservation interventions always take place in social-ecological systems (SES) (i.e., ecological systems integrated with human actors). Evaluating the impact of an intervention in an SES, therefore, means taking into account the counterfactuals assumed by different human actors. Use of different counterfactuals by different actors will give rise to perceived differences in the impacts of interventions, which may lead to disagreement about its success or the effectiveness of the underlying approach. Despite that there are biophysical biodiversity trends, it is often true that no single counterfactual is definitively the right one for conservation assessment, so multiple evaluations of intervention efficacy could be considered justifiable. Therefore, we propose calculating the sum of perceived differences, which captures the range of impact estimates associated with different actors in a given SES. The sum of perceived differences gives some indication of how closely actors in an SES agree on the impacts of an intervention. We applied the concept of perceived differences to a set of global, national, and regional case studies (e.g., global realization of Aichi Target 11 for marine protected areas, effect of biodiversity offsetting on vegetation condition in Australia, and influence of conservation measures on an endangered ungulate in Central Asia). We explored approaches for minimizing the sum, including a combination of negotiation and structured decision making, careful alignment of expectations on scope and measurement, and explicit recognition of any intractable differences between stakeholders.","[Bull, Joseph W.; Smith, Robert J.] Univ Kent, Sch Anthropol & Conservat, Durrell Inst Conservat & Ecol, Canterbury CT2 7NR, Kent, England; [Strange, Niels] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Food & Resource Econ, Rolighedsvej 23, DK-1958 Copenhagen, Denmark; [Strange, Niels] Univ Copenhagen, Ctr Macroecol Evolut & Climate, Rolighedsvej 23, DK-1958 Copenhagen, Denmark; [Gordon, Ascelin] RMIT Univ, Sch Global Urban & Social Studies, Melbourne, Vic 3000, Australia",j.w.bull@kent.ac.uk,51,6,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0888-8892,CONSERV BIOL,Conserv.

In this context, understanding orchid reproductive strategy would be beneficial to orchid conservation. In this study, we investigated the floral biology and pollination ecology of Paphiopedilum spicerianum, a critically endangered orchid in China. P. spicerianum is self-compatible, but dependent upon insects for pollination. Two hoverflies, Allobaccha nubilipennis and Episyrphus balteatus, were observed and confirmed as pollinators of P. spicerianum. E. balteatus was the main pollinator of P. spicerianum, having the higher visitation frequency during our observations over three years. P. spicerianum exploited E. balteatus by food deception, and shared the pollinator with co-flowering Polygonum pubescens (Polygonaceae), a nectar rewarding species. Although the population of P. spicerianum was very small and the habitat was highly fragmented, P. spicerianum achieved a stable reproductive success measured as natural fruit set (mean 25.7% pooled over three seasons). Co-flowering P. pubescens plants may play an important role in attracting pollinators and maintaining a stable reproductive success for P. spicerianum. These results demonstrate the interrelationships of plants, pollinators and food sources that need to be understood when developing conservation plans for endangered orchids. (C) 2020 The Authors.

Scoping surveys of literature and thematisation of common issues related to hippo ecology, human-hippo conflict and conservation were used for data collection. Hippos play integral ecological roles, such as habitat engineering through track creation in water systems, nutrient recycling by swirl spread of highly organic faeces, harbouring commensal water birds, parasites and leeches. Regardless, the hippo population is not well documented for the country with indications of sharp declines in freshwater systems during the period 1982 to 1992 and gradual recovery thereafter. Habitat degradation, water pollution, climate change, drought-induced extreme water level fluctuation, poaching and deliberate culling, as part of problem-hippo control (PHC), are key drivers of hippo population declines. However, it appears much of the attention is on human-hippo conflict and its consequences, resulting in negative perceptions among human communities. Commercial breeding of hippos for non-consumptive tourism, and export-orientated meat, and ethnomedical mimics of hippo sweat and milk products are new, potentially viable, but unexplored options for conserving and increasing the population of the species in Zimbabwe. Currently, it appears more anti-hippo poaching patrols and awareness campaigns especially in water systems outside protected areas may be key to sustaining the current hippo population. For the future, it is essential to increase the scope for hippo census data to include water systems inside and outside protected areas for sustainable conservation of the species in the country.","[Utete, Beaven] Chinhoyi Univ Technol, Dept Wildlife Ecol & Conservat, Chinhoyi, Zimbabwe",beavenu@gmail.com,114,4,4,ZOOLOGICAL SOC SOUTHERN AFRICA,SCOTTSVILLE,"AFRICAN ZOOLOGY CIRCULATION OFFICE, UNIV KWAZULU-NATAL, SCHOOL BIOL & CONSERVATION SCI, P B X01, SCOTTSVILLE 3209, SOUTH AFRICA",1562-7020,AFR ZOOL,Afr.

Evidence rarely considers the complexities of social-ecological systems. The Social-Ecological Systems Framework (SESF) is an adaptable yet structured approach for understanding the processes that lead to changes in natural resources, using a systems-based approach that aims to treat ecological and social components equally. Few conservation planning and policy initiatives have implemented the SESF to assess the interlinked social and ecological consequences of conservation policies. We apply the SESF to explore the barriers to the potential implementation of a policy of consumptive utilisation of wildlife in Kenya, a policy regarded as successful in several southern African countries. Using secondary data and expert review we developed a conceptual model of the social-ecological system associated with consumptive utilisation of wildlife in Kenya. We then analysed how different combinations of first and second-tier variables interacted to create focal action situations, and subsequently identified seven barriers to this policy. Our analysis revealed that game ranching would require large-scale investment in effective monitoring systems, new regulations, training, market development and research, considerations about equity, and devolved ownership of wildlife. The least barriers existed for game farming. The SESF appears to be a useful framework for this purpose. In particular, it can help to reveal potential social and ecological barriers which conservation policies might face in attempting to meet intended goals. The information required to implement the SESF are necessarily cross-disciplinary, which can make it challenging to synthesise.","[Tyrrell, Peter; Kamanga, John] South Rift Assoc Landowners, POB 15289, Nairobi 00509, Kenya; [Tyrrell, Peter] Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, Wildlife Conservat Res Unit, Oxford, England; [Brehony, Peadar] Univ Cambridge, Dept Geog, Downing Pl, Cambridge, England; [Waruingi, Lucy] African Conservat Ctr, POB 15289, Nairobi 00509, Kenya; [Kaelo, Dickson] Kenya Wildlife Conservancies Assoc, POB 1038, Nairobi 00517, Kenya",peterdavidtyrrell@gmaill.com,76,2,2,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0006-3207,BIOL CONSERV,Biol.

This study was conducted in the Caijiachuan watershed of the Loess Plateau in western Shanxi, China, and explored the practical, and optimal configuration of stand structures in a Robinia pseudoacacia forest. Accordingly, one hundred and ninety-five standard plots (20 x 20 m(2)), including six stand densities (similar to 500, similar to 1000, similar to 1500, similar to 2000, similar to 2500 and similar to 3000 plants.hm(-2)), were established. Twenty functional indicators and ten structural indicators were monitored and investigated from June to September each year from 2017 to 2018. The results suggested that the forest was divided into three levels of low efficiency, which were mild (II), moderate (III), and severe (IV), based on the soil and water conservation ecological benefits index (SWBI). The trends of the polarization of the values of the stand structure indicators appeared in forests II, III and IV, and this phenomenon became increasingly obvious with increasing levels of low efficiency. Analysis of the influence factors indicated that the climate of this region exhibited a warming and drying trend, the soil moisture content presented a decreasing trend, and the vegetation growth rate slowed. The stand density (SD), tree height (TH), canopy density (CD) and the leaf area index (LAI) were the main controllable factors that influenced the low SWBI of the R. pseudoacacia forest. The results of the optimal configuration of the stand structure suggested that the SD should be controlled between 1000 and 1600 plants.hm(-2), the TH should be controlled between 7 and 9 m, the CD should be controlled between 0.6 and 0.8, and the LAI should be controlled between 2.5 and 5. In comparison to the SWBI of the existing stand structure configuration, the optimal configuration is expected to improve the SWBI by approximately 86%, 200% and 600% in R. pseudoacacia forests I, II and III, respectively. These results will provide a more scientific and complete reference for the optimization of the stand structures of low-efficiency R. pseudoacacia forests.","[Hou, Guirong; Bi, Huaxing; Wang, Ning; Cui, Yanhong; Zhao, Danyang; Ma, Xiaozhi; Wang, Shanshan] Beijing Forestry Univ, Coll Soil & Water Conservat, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China; [Bi, Huaxing] Natl Observat & Res Stn, Forest Ecosyst Studies, Jixian 042200, Shanxi, Peoples R China; [Bi, Huaxing] Beijing Collaborat Innovat Ctr Ecoenvironm Improv, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Hou, Guirong; Bi, Huaxing] Beijing Forestry Univ, Key Lab State Forestry Adm Soil & Water Conservat, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China; [Bi, Huaxing] Beijing Forestry Univ, Beijing Engn Res Ctr Soil & Water Conservat, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China; [Bi, Huaxing] Beijing Forestry Univ, Engn Res Ctr Forestry Ecol Engn, Minist Educ, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China; [Wei, Xi] Shanxi Agr Univ, Coll Forestry, Taigu 030800, Peoples R China",bhx@bjfu.edu.cn,57,5,6,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1470-160X,ECOL INDIC,Ecol.

The application of eDNA in ecology and conservation has grown enormously in recent years, but without a concurrent growth in appreciation of its strengths and limitations. In many situations, eDNA may either not work, or it may work but not provide the information needed. Problems with (1) imperfect detection, (2) abundance quantification, (3) taxonomic assignment, (4) eDNA spatial and temporal dynamics, (5) data analysis and interpretation, and (6) assessing ecological status have all been significant. The technique has often been used without a careful evaluation of the technical challenges and complexities involved, and a determination made that eDNA is the appropriate method for the species or environment of interest. It is therefore important to evaluate the scope and relevance of eDNA-based studies, and to identify critical considerations that need to be taken into account before using the approach. We review and synthesize eDNA studies published to date to highlight the opportunities and limitations of utilizing eDNA in ecology and conservation. We identify potential ways of reducing limitations in eDNA analysis, and demonstrate how eDNA and traditional surveys can complement each other.","[Beng, Kingsly C.; Corlett, Richard T.] Chinese Acad Sci, Xishuangbanna Trop Bot Garden, Ctr Integrat Conservat, Mengla 666303, Yunnan, Peoples R China; [Beng, Kingsly C.; Corlett, Richard T.] Chinese Acad Sci, Core Bot Gardens, Ctr Conservat Biol, Mengla 666303, Yunnan, Peoples R China; [Beng, Kingsly C.] Leibniz Inst Freshwater Ecol & Inland Fisheries, Dept Ecosyst Res, Muggelseedamm 310, D-12587 Berlin, Germany",beng@xtbg.org.cn; corlett@xtbg.org.cn,295,56,58,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0960-3115,BIODIVERS CONSERV,Biodivers.

The result shows that local economic structure has a significant impact on the SWC effect. When all the other predictors are held constant, if the proportion of agricultural sector in local GDP increases by 1%, the soil erosion (SE) control degree increases by 0.18-0.40%; if the proportion of industrial sector increases by 1%, the SE control degree decreases by 0.18-0.37%; and if the proportion of service sector increases by 1%, the SE control degree decreases by 0.28-0.40%. This paper argues the reason is that when facing fiscal pressure, county governments are less incentivized to implement SWC for agricultural development and focus more on the development of the industrial and service sectors. The pursuit of economic growth has actually resulted in an extrusion effect for the SWC. Therefore, to improve the SWC effect, it is optimal to enhance the economic benefits and efficiency of agriculture to promote a virtuous circle between SWC and agricultural development. Moreover, more investment in agriculture-dominated economies and in more densely populated areas, as well as control at early stage when the SE area is still small, are found to be effective in improving the efficacy of the SWC measures.","[Liu, Lei] Sichuan Univ, Sch Publ Adm, Chengdu 610000, Peoples R China; [Di, Baofeng] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Inst Disaster Management & Reconstruct, Sichuan Univ, Chengdu 610000, Peoples R China; [Di, Baofeng] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Res Ctr Integrated Disaster Risk Reduct & Emergen, Sichuan Univ, Chengdu 610000, Peoples R China; [Di, Baofeng; Zhang, Mingyi] Sichuan Univ, Coll Architecture & Environm, Chengdu 610000, Peoples R China",dibaofeng@scu.edu.cn,62,9,10,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-3449,RESOUR CONSERV RECY,Resour.

FEK has proved to be useful as an alternative reference of biological changes in data-poor scenarios. Yet, recreational fisher knowledge has rarely been included in scientific studies despite being a source of FEK. Here, the use of recreational FEK to assess the conservation status of marine ecosystems in Galicia (NW Spain) was evaluated. Galicia has a highly complex marine socioecological system that includes both a large global commercial fleet and a powerful recreational sector, alongside other important stakeholders (e.g., tourism, aquaculture). Anglers and spear fishers were asked to provide their perceptions of the conservation status of fish stocks and the impacts on marine ecosystems. Face-toface interviews were transcribed into text and analyzed using text mining tools. Key concepts were used to quantify fishers' perceptions of changes in their target fish stocks and quantify the main impacts on marine ecosystems. Overfishing and habitat loss, followed by reduction in biodiversity, pollution, and warming temperatures were considered to be the main drivers of the poor status of cephalopods and finfish stocks. Perceived temporal declines in fish stocks were consistent with available biological data, highlighting the potential for recreational FEK to be used to assess long-term ecological changes. It was important to seek opinions from different users, including fishers from traditional commercial and recreational fisheries, as these groups had good knowledge of the impacts on natural and cultural community heritage. The poor status of ballann wrasse (Labrus bergylta) and kelp beds was identified, which was of concern due to it being a key species in coastal ecosystems. Use of FEK is a good approach to develop knowledge of these systems, but broader monitoring programs are needed to protect the future of these ecosystems.","[Pita, Pablo; Villasante, Sebastin] Univ Santiago de Compostela, Fac Polit & Social Sci, Dept Appl Econ, Santiago De Compostela, Spain; [Pita, Pablo; Antelo, Manel; Villasante, Sebastin] Campus Mar,Int Campus Excellence, Vigo, Spain; [Antelo, Manel] Univ Santiago de Compostela, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Santiago De Compostela, Spain; [Hyder, Kieran] Ctr Environm Fisheries & Aquaculture Sci, Lowestoft, Suffolk, England; [Hyder, Kieran] Univ East Anglia, Sch Environm Sci, Norwich Res Pk, Norwich, Norfolk, England; [Vingada, Jos] Univ Minho, CBMA Mol & Environm Biol Ctr, Campus Gualtar, Braga, Portugal; [Vingada, Jos] Univ Aveiro, Ctr Environm & Marine Studies, Dept Environm & Planning, Aveiro, Portugal",pablo.pita@usc.es,111,4,4,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,FRONT MAR SCI,Front.

This rapid expansion has generated new data on how animals interact with and respond to variation in their environment, resulting in important ecological, physiological, and evolutionary insights. Although understanding the finer details of animal locations has important management relevance, applied studies are not prominent in the movement ecology literature. This is despite the long history of applied studies of animal movement and the urgent and growing need for evidence-based conservation guidance, especially in the challenging field of human-wildlife interactions. The goal of this review is to evaluate the realized contribution of tracking-based animal movement ecology to solving specific conservation problems, and to identify barriers that may hinder expansion of that contribution. To do this, we (a) briefly review the history and technologies used in animal tracking and bio-logging, (b) use a series of literature searches to evaluate the frequency with which movement ecology studies are designed to solve specific conservation problems, and (c) use this information to identify challenges that may limit the applied relevance of the field of movement ecology, and to propose pathways to expand that applied relevance. Our literature review quantifies the limited extent to which research in the field of movement ecology is designed to solve specific conservation problems, but also the fact that such studies are slowly becoming more prevalent. We discuss how barriers that limit application of these principles are likely due to constraints imposed by the types of data used commonly in the field. Problems of scale mismatch, error compounding, and data paucity all create challenges that are relevant to the field of movement ecology but may be especially pertinent in applied situations. Finding solutions to these problems will create new opportunity for movement ecologists to contribute to conservation science.","[Katzner, Todd E.] US Geol Survey, Forest & Rangeland Ecosyst Sci Ctr, Boise, ID 83702 USA; [Arlettaz, Raphael] Bern Univ, Inst Ecol & Evolut, Div Conservat Biol, Bern, Switzerland",tkatzner@usgs.gov; raphael.arlettaz@iee.unibe.ch,89,19,19,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",2296-701X,FRONT ECOL EVOL,Front.

ILFs are typically recognized for their biodiversity, carbon storage, protection of hydroecological systems and other ecosystem services. However, IFLs are distinctive among other conservation efforts because they do not immediately prioritize conservation approaches that have goals of alleviating human poverty or improving well-being. The prevailing view is that IFL conservation should engage with ecocentric models of conservation. In this article, we leverage political ecology's analytical attention to power, institutions, identities, and scales to make suggestions on ways in which to integrate biocentric conservation considerations into IFL practices. From a scoping literature review, we found the following areas are especially critical for the future of IFL conservation: (1) prioritizing Indigenous Peoples and Local Communities (IPLC) as actors and beneficiaries of conservation; (2) identifying the value of knowledge integration and co-production for conservation; (3) addressing heterogenous communities and equity impacts, and (4) the need for procedural mechanisms in conservation initiatives that support nesting Indigenous Peoples and Local Communities management and governance in polycentric systems. Furthermore, the development of diagnostic questions of scaling community-based conservation and adaptive strategies beyond their original scope in terms of community definitions, landscape and political context may be beneficial for addressing multistakeholder needs, identifying more equitable approaches, sharing strategies and obtaining successful outcomes in IFL conservation.","[Zanotti, Laura] Purdue Univ, Dept Anthropol, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Knowles, Natalie] Univ Waterloo, Geog & Environm Management GEM, Waterloo, ON, Canada",lzanotti@purdue.edu; nlbknowles@uwaterloo.ca,79,4,4,UNIV ARIZONA LIBRARIES,TUCSON,"UNIV ARIZONA LIBRARIES, TUCSON, AZ 85721 USA",1073-0451,J POLIT ECOL,J.

We tested the effect of habitat and anthropogenic disturbance on communities of cavity-nesting taxa, with specific emphasis on bees, wasps, and their natural enemies. Methods In oases of BCP and desert neighbor environments, trap-nesting taxa were evaluated in response to factors affecting the nest abundance, richness, and community structure. We used statistical models to find correlates of nest abundance and patterns of diversity, as well as ecological analyses to determine the effect of habitat and human disturbance on species diversity and community structure. Results Solar irradiation, distance to a perennial waterbody and relative humidity influenced the presence of nests, number of brood cells, and parasitism. In general, abundance, species richness, and parasitism were higher in oases, especially in those with less human disturbance. Bees did not discriminate between oases and deserts to nest, whereas mud-daubing wasps were more dependent of oases. The degree of anthropogenic disturbance did not affect the occurrence of parasitism, but it had an adverse effect on the parasitism intensity (number of attacked cells). The community structure was more complex and even in oases and low-disturbed sites. The similarity between sites did not exceed 30%, and the proportion of shared species between oases and deserts varied from 2.7% to 26.6%. Main conclusions The oases of Baja California are functioning as mesic islands in the desert, each oasis hosting a unique community of cavity-nesting taxa. About 65% of the nests and 50% of species occurred exclusively in the oasis. Thus, cavity-nesting species that depend on mesic conditions could be threatened if the oases of BCP disappear in the future. Local conditions in the oases and deserts of the BCP are shaping the community structure. However, large-scale factors such as climate can influence the seasonality and occurrence of species within the community of cavity-nesting dwellers. Since habitat loss and fragmentation can degrade the oases' functionality, strategies to maintain the ecosystem services of pollination and biological control should be included in the conservation programs of these fragile habitats.","[Falcon-Brindis, Armando; Jimenez Jimenez, Maria Luisa; Rodriguez-Estrella, Ricardo] Ctr Invest Biol Noroeste CIBNOR, Conservat & Environm Planning Program, Av Inst Politecn Nacl 195, La Paz 23096, Baja California, Mexico; [Rodriguez-Estrella, Ricardo] Univ Arizona, Sch Nat Resources & Environm, Tucson, AZ USA",estrella@cibnor.mx,85,0,0,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

Landscape analysis can help to better understand raptor habitat requirements and the degree of tolerance to habitat changes at different scales. We used a landscape ecology perspective to determine the nesting habitat selection of endemic and endangered Cuban Black Hawk, and using ecological niche modeling, we obtained the potential distribution of nests to evaluate the effectiveness of protected areas (PAs) for raptor conservation. Nesting habitat selection was related to breeding success at a landscape scale using data from 27 different nesting sites during 2012-2013 breeding seasons. The potential nesting areas distribution was compared with current officially PAs design in the central region of Cuba. All nests were located in mangrove swamp. Pairs chose nesting sites with low soil-vegetation moisture and low soil reflectance. At the landscape level, they selected low shape complexity of patches and few patches of coastal vegetation around nesting sites which contained similar mangrove patch size and shape. The potential distribution of nests increased close to the coastline. The model predicted a suitable narrow area of 556 km(2), and the most favorable nesting area represented 2% of this total. 33% of nests were located within officially natural protected areas while 27% were close to or inside highly threatened areas. A 16% of high to medium suitable nesting habitat overlaps with urban areas. Currently, PAs contain 23% of the nesting area distribution. Our study shows landscape ecology and nest-site selection approach is crucial to evaluate the persistence of Cuban Black Hawk, as environmental variables and human activity can be related to its productivity. This approach can be applied in conservation strategies of island raptors.","[Ferrer-Sanchez, Yarelys] Univ Tecn Estatal Quevedo, Quevedo, Los Rios, Ecuador; [Ferrer-Sanchez, Yarelys; Rodriguez-Estrella, Ricardo] Ctr Invest Biol Noroeste, La Paz, Baja Calif Sur, Mexico; [Rodriguez-Estrella, Ricardo] Univ Arizona, Sch Nat Resources & Environm, Tucson, AZ USA; [Angel Martinez-Morales, Miguel] Colegio Frontera Sur, Unidad San Cristobal, Dept Conservac Biodiversidad, San Cristobal de las Casa, Chiapas, Mexico",estrella@cibnor.mx,82,2,2,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

Application of this approach to a coral reef fishery in French Polynesia recommended a portfolio of development-, livelihood-, and ecosystem-based interventions, thus suggesting a shift from the current resource-focused approach toward a more social-ecological perspective.

Especially when located on bird migration routes, the emergence of a civil airport will have a large impact on birds, resulting in immeasurable ecological loss. Therefore, it is necessary to carry out an evaluation of the ecological impact on birds at the airport site selection stage for the sustainable development of humans and the nature. Geographically, Dalian, China, is an important site in the bird migration routes in northeast Asia, and the National Conservation Area of Snake Island and Laotieshan Mountain located in the south of Dalian has been included in the Man and Biosphere Programme (MBP) network as a biosphere reserve.

Their recovery from <50 in a few hundred km(2) to >500 occupying 13,000 km(2) of agro-pastoral Saurashtra landscape, Gujarat, India is an enigma. We review and evaluate the multidisciplinary aspects of lion conservation-strategy that covers ecology, conflict, community perceptions, economics, management, and politics. The history of modern lions in India dates back to similar to 4-6,000 BP, but evidence suggests presence as early as 10-15,000 BP. Asiatic lions can be distinguished from African lions by their belly-folds; adult males and females weighing 160 (SE 4.7) and 116 (SE 3.7) kg, respectively. Lion density ranged from 2 to 15/100 km(2) in the Saurashtra landscape. Demographic parameters of Asiatic lions were comparable to African lions. Prides were related females and cubs; males lived separately in hierarchical coalitions having overlapping ranges with multiple prides. Lionesses mated with multiple coalitions to reduce infanticide and enhance genetic diversity of their progeny. Few hectares of scrub sufficed as daytime refuges, while >4 km(2) patches were required for breeding. Sink populations outside Gir Protected Area (PA) were maintained by immigrants. Lions within PA fed primarily on wild-prey, while scavenging and predation on livestock was the mainstay outside. Monetary compensation for livestock-depredation, legal-protection, lion-related profits, combined with religious and cultural sentiments were major drivers of population recovery. The lion has become a socio-political instrument in Gujarat, which despite a Supreme Court directive, has not parted with founders to establish another population. Threats from epidemics loom large and currently a canine distemper virus outbreak is prevalent. Attacks on humans were rare, however, with increasing lion density the intensity of conflict is increasing. This, coupled with lowered tolerance of communities due to erosion of traditional values sets the stage for retaliation. Future of lions outside PA is uncertain as breeding refuges and their connecting corridors are vanishing rapidly. A human-free National Park of similar to 1,000 km(2) is essential for ensuring a viable population that retains its ecological role and evolutionary potential. Legalizing lion based ecotourism by forming village consortia holds promise to prevent land conversion and promoting lion-human coexistence.","[Jhala, Yadvendradev V.; Banerjee, Kausik; Chakrabarti, Stotra; Gogoi, Keshab] Wildlife Inst India, Dept Anim Ecol & Conservat Biol, Dehra Dun, India; [Basu, Parabita] Ekjut, Chakradharpur, India; [Singh, Kartikeya] Wildlife & Forestry Serv, Ujjain, Madhya Pradesh, India; [Dave, Chittaranjan] Sci Govt Coll, Gariyadhar, India",jhalay@wii.gov.in,156,10,10,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",2296-701X,FRONT ECOL EVOL,Front.

However, producing ecological knowledge and making research results available for decision makers cannot guarantee by itself that conservation policies will be improved. Knowledge producers have to develop robust strategies to make their expertise count in public decision-making. In the implementation of such strategies, ecological knowledge is a critical resource that can be used to support ambitious environmental initiatives. To bring some new insights for researchers and practitioners, we therefore analysed different tactics for the production and use of knowledge to improve biodiversity conservation. Our case study involved two organisations, an ecology research team and a conservation NGO. Both of them adopted a proactive knowledge-based strategy in an attempt to directly influence biodiversity conservation. Their scientific and expert knowledge was partially taken into account in the definition and implementation of public conservation policies. However significant progress was achieved only when they developed a strong advocacy in favour of biodiversity conservation in addition to knowledge production.

Planning for nature conservation has increasingly emphasised the concepts of resilience and spatial networks. Although the importance of habitat networks for individual species is clear, their significance for long-term ecological resilience and multi-species conservation strategies is less established. 2. Referencing spatial network theory, we describe the conceptual basis for defining and assessing a network of wildlife areas that supports species' resilience to multiple forms of perturbations and pressures. We explore actions that could enhance network resilience at a range of scales, based on ecological principles, with reference to four well-established strategies for intervention in a spatial network (Better, Bigger, More and Joined) from the influential Making Space for Nature report by Lawton etal. (2010). 3. Building existing theory into useable and scalable approaches applicable to large numbers of species is challenging but tractable. We illustrate the policy context, describe the elements of a long-term adaptive management plan and provide example actions, metrics and targets for early implementation using England as a case study, where there is an opportunity to include large-scale ecological planning in a newly launched 25-year environment plan. 4. Policy implications. The concept of resilient ecological networks has attracted scientific and political support, but there is no consensus on what a resilient network would look like, or how to assess it. Therefore, it is unclear whether existing targets for action will be sufficient to achieve network resilience. We show that the scientific principles to place resilience and network theory at the heart of large-scale and long-term environmental planning are established and ready to implement in practice. Delivering a resilient network to support nature recovery is achievable and can be integrated with ongoing conservation actions and targets, by assessing their effectiveness on properties of the entire network. England's 25 Year Environment Plan promises to deliver a natural environment that is protected and enhanced for the future and so provides the ideal testbed.","[Isaac, Nick J.

Many populations occur at low densities in small fragmented forest patches and face pressure from habitat loss, degradation, and fragmentation, poaching, and developmental activities. Most studies have taken place In China and Nepal; few studies have been conducted in the other countries, creating a gap in documentation. Therefore, there is an urgent need to increase our knowledge regarding the ecology of the red panda and its threats. Based on literature regarding the red panda, we attempt to summarize the progress in research on its current distribution, ecology, and existing threats in the wild, highlight conservation approaches and recommend future directions. Recent studies have focused on wild populations; however, earlier studies emphasized captive. China and Nepal have a wider elevational range in red panda distribution (2000-3800 m) compared to other countries. Bamboo mixed subtropical and temperate forest and other associated variables, including a relatively high cover of bamboo, shrubs, and canopy, high densities of fallen logs, relatively steep slopes, and proximity to water sources, are ecologically important in the habitat. Due to differences in methodologies, prior estimates on population size and habitat area have varied. The genetic diversity of red pandas is high in China, but a lack of such data in other range countries makes subspecies classification unclear. Movement, microbiota, pathogens, and threats have been insufficiently documented; thus, we recommended extensive research in these areas. Furthermore, regional cooperation in research, data sharing, and policy implementation are urgently needed to protect wild panda populations.","[Thapa, Arjun; Hu, Yibo; Wei, Fuwen] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Zool, Key Lab Anim Ecol & Conservat Biol, 1-5 Beichenxi Rd, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Thapa, Arjun; Wei, Fuwen] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Int Coll, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Hu, Yibo; Wei, Fuwen] Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Excellence Anim Evolut & Genet, Kunming 650223, Yunnan, Peoples R China",weifw@ioz.ac.an,87,14,17,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0006-3207,BIOL CONSERV,Biol.

However, hampered by data limitations, including incomplete and spatially biased data, relatively few studies have used multidecadal datasets or have examined changes in biogeography from a historical perspective. The black-billed capercaillie (Tetrao urogalloides) is a large capercaillie (classified as Least Concern [LC] on the IUCN red list) that has undergone a dramatic decline in population during the late 20th century and is considered endangered. Its conservation status is pessimistic, and the species requires immediate protection. Therefore, we supplemented a historical dataset to identify changes in this bird's range and population in northeast China over the long term. The study area spanned Heilongjiang Province, Jilin Province, and the northeast corner of Inner Mongolia in northeast China. We integrated an ecological niche model (BIOMOD2) with long-term ecological data on this species to estimate the magnitude of change in distribution over time. Our results revealed a 35.25% reduction in the current distribution of this species compared to their potential distribution in the 1970s. This decline is expected to continue under climate change. For example, the future range loss was estimated to be 38.79 +/- 0.22% (8.64-90.19%), and the actual state could be worse, because the baseline range of the model was greater than the real range in the 2000s, showing a 12.39% overestimation. To overcome this poor outlook, a conservation strategy should be established in sensitive areas, including the southwestern Greater Khingan Mountains and northern Lesser Khingan Mountains. Actions that should be considered include field investigations, establishing a monitor network, designing ecological corridors, and cooperating with local inhabitants, governments, and conservation biologists to improve the conservation of the black-billed capercaillie.","[Yang, Li; Zhang, Chao; Chen, Minhao; Li, Jingxin; Yang, Lei; Huo, Zhaomin; Ahmad, Shahid; Luan, Xiaofeng] Beijing Forestry Univ, Sch Nat Conservat, Beijing, Peoples R China",luanxiaofeng@bjfu.edu.cn,49,6,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

We conducted a study in western Bhutan on the inter-specific dynamics between tigers, leopards, and dholes, and their subsequent impact on livestock and crop losses faced by agro-pastoralists. We found that when a tiger was present in forests surrounding villages, leopards and dholes occupied areas closer to village croplands and preyed on a higher relative abundance of wild herbivore crop raiders, thereby significantly reducing crop (beta = -2.25, p < .0001) and livestock losses (beta = -2.39, p <= .0001). In contrast, leopards and dholes occupied areas in deep forests farther from croplands when a tiger was absent in the village vicinity, leading to increased predation on a higher abundance of untended free-ranging livestock. We posit that justifications for large predator conservation based on their iconic status is not persuasive to rural farmers residing close to their habitat and suffering crop and livestock loss. There is a need to determine ecological services from apex predators to farmers which may dissuade them from retaliatory killings. We recommend conservation practitioners conserve large apex predators to maintain optimal inter-specific interactions in a large predator guild to benefit rural socio-economy.","[Thinley, Phuntsho] Ugyen Wangchuck Inst Conservat & Environm Res, Dept Forests & Pk Serv, Lamoigoenpa, Bumthang, Bhutan; [Rajaratnam, Rajanathan] Univ New England, Geog & Planning, Armidale, NSW 2351, Australia; [Thinley, Phuntsho; Lassoie, James P.; Morreale, Stephen J.; Curtis, Paul D.] Cornell Univ, Nat Resources, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Thinley, Phuntsho; Vernes, Karl] Univ New England, Ecosyst Management, Armidale, NSW 2351, Australia; [Leki, Leki; Phuntsho, Sonam; Dorji, Tshering; Dorji, Pema] Jigme Dorji Natl Pk, Dept Forests & Pk Serv, Gasa, Bhutan",pthinley@uwice.gov.bt; rrajarat@une.edu.au; lassoie@cornell.edu; sjm11@cornell.edu; pdc1@cornell.edu; kvernes@une.edu.au,57,16,16,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0006-3207,BIOL CONSERV,Biol.

Research on cooperation in businesses, economics, psychology, and natural resource management has identified shared social and social-ecological dynamics, reviewed and categorized in this article that can create unwanted surprises and problems for conservation efforts. Cooperation may fail when: (1) individual and group benefits are in conflict (social dilemmas) or (2) social-ecological systems become caught in problem-causing and problem-enhancing feedbacks (SES traps). Knowing about and recognizing these dynamics can help decision makers to understand and change key elements of problems and learn from the experiences of others. Social dilemmas have winners and losers, and involve give-some or take-some choices; SES traps are lose-lose situations. Solutions to problems of cooperation in conservation contexts involve identifying the conservation objective and context, diagnosing systemic social dilemmas and SES traps, and developing practical solutions that work with group processes and individuals toward shared and positively reinforcing goals, goal structures, and expectations. Research on cooperation in conservation has largely ignored problems of scale, scaling, and group heterogeneity. The field would benefit from a shift from a probabilistic, empirical approach to a stronger theory-driven, mechanistic, and more diagnostic approach.","[Cumming, Graeme S.] James Cook Univ, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia",gscumming@gmail.com,89,23,23,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1755-263X,CONSERV LETT,Conserv.

We confirmed the presence of G. gulolineatus at four of 11 historical sites, but we did not observe it at any additional caves. At the three known cave sites with greatest abundance, visual counts per survey ranged 0-19 salamanders in 2017-2019. There was no apparent trend in abundance at Berry Cave. Visual counts declined 65% since the mid-2000s at Meads Quarry Cave and 80% since the early 1980s at Mudflats Cave. Mark-recapture studies in 160-m of cave stream at Berry Cave in 2017-2018 and 900-m of cave stream at Meads Quarry Cave in 2008 yielded population size estimates that ranged from 34-78 and 15-65 individuals, respectively.

Advocates suggest that ILAs are viable implementing pathways for addressing global challenges such as biodiversity loss, poverty alleviation, and climate change mitigation and adaptation. However, we argue that recent advances in ILA research and discourse have tended to emphasize the social and governance dimensions, while overlooking ecological factors and inadequately considering potential trade-offs between the two fields. Objectives By raising the issue of inadequate integration of ecology in ILAs and providing some general design suggestions, we aim to support and incentivise better design and practice of ILAs, supplementing existing design principles. Methods In this perspective we draw on the recent literature and our collective experience to highlight the need, and the means, to re-integrate ecology into landscape approaches. Results We suggest that better incorporation of the ecological dimension requires the integration of two approaches: one focusing on conventional scientific studies of biodiversity and biophysical parameters; and the other focusing on the engagement of relevant stakeholders using various participatory methods. We provide some general guidelines for how these approaches can be incorporated within ILA design and implementation. Conclusion Re-integrating ecology into ILAs will not only improve ecological understanding (and related objectives, plans and monitoring), but will also generate insights into local and traditional knowledge, encourage transdisciplinary enquiry and reveal important conservation-development trade-offs and synergies.","[Reed, James; Djoudi, Houria; Laumonier, Yves; Yuliani, Elizabeth L.; Sunderland, Terry] Ctr Int Forestry Res, Bogor, Indonesia; [Kusters, Koen] Tropenbos Int, NL-6717 LT Ede, Gelderland, Netherlands; [Barlow, Jos] Univ Lancaster, Lancaster Environm Ctr, Lancaster, England; [Balinga, Michael] West Africa Biodivers & Climate Change WA BiCC Pr, Tetra Tech ARD, Accra, Ghana; [Borah, Joli Rumi; Sunderland, Terry] Univ British Columbia, Fac Forestry, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Carmenta, Rachel] Univ East Anglia, Tyndall Ctr, Norwich Res Pk, Norwich, Norfolk, England; [Carmenta, Rachel] Univ East Anglia, Sch Int Dev, Norwich Res Pk, Norwich, Norfolk, England; [Chervier, Colas; Laumonier, Yves] Ctr Cooperat Int Rech Agron Dev CIRAD, Montpellier, France; [Gumbo, Davison; Moombe, Kaala B.] Ctr Int Forestry Res, Lusaka, Zambia",j.reed@cgiar.org,137,3,3,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-2973,LANDSCAPE ECOL,Landsc.

In this review, we focus on phenotypic and genetic differentiation between eastern and western monarchs, with the goal of informing researchers and policy-makers who are interested in monarch conservation. Eastern and western monarchs occupy distinct environments and show some evidence for phenotypic differentiation, particularly for migration-associated traits, though population genetic and genomic studies suggest that they are indistinguishable from one another. We suggest future studies that could improve our understanding of differences between eastern and western monarchs. We also discuss the concept of adaptive capacity in eastern and western monarchs as well as non-migratory populations outside of the monarch's primary North American range.

Overall, our analysis highlights the increasing breadth of the field, illustrating that there is room for more diversity of ecologists and conservationists today than ever before.","[Anderson, Sean C.] Fisheries & Oceans Canada, Pacific Biol Stn, Nanaimo, BC, Canada; [Elsen, Paul R.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Environm Sci Policy & Management, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Elsen, Paul R.] Wildlife Conservat Soc, Global Conservat Program, Bronx, NY USA; [Hughes, Brent B.] Sonoma State Univ, Dept Biol, Rohnert Pk, CA 94928 USA; [Tonietto, Rebecca K.] Univ Michigan, Dept Biol, Flint, MI 48503 USA; [Bletz, Molly C.] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Biol, Boston, MA 02125 USA; [Gill, David A.] Duke Univ, Marine Lab, Nicholas Sch Environm, Beaufort, NC 28516 USA; [Holgerson, Meredith A.] St Olaf Coll, Dept Biol, Northfield, MN 55057 USA; [Holgerson, Meredith A.] St Olaf Coll, Dept Environm Studies, Northfield, MN 55057 USA; [Holgerson, Meredith A.] Cornell Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Ithaca, NY USA; [Kuebbing, Sara E.] Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Biol Sci, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA; [McDonough MacKenzie, Caitlin] Univ Maine, Climate Change Inst, Orono, ME USA; [Meek, Mariah H.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Integrat Biol, AgBio Res, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Meek, Mariah H.] Michigan State Univ, Ecol Evolut & Behav Program, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Verissimo, Diogo] Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, Oxford, England; [Verissimo, Diogo] San Diego Zoo Global, Inst Conservat Res, Escondido, CA USA",sean.anderson@dfo-mpo.gc.ca,48,10,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1540-9295,FRONT ECOL ENVIRON,Front.

Yet, examples of integration across realms are relatively scarce, with most targeting priorities in a single realm, such as marine or freshwater, while minimizing threats originating in terrestrial ecosystems. To date, no study has optimized priorities across multiple realms to produce a spatially explicit integrated conservation plan that simultaneously accounts for multiple human activities at a national scale. This represents a major gap in the application of existing cross-realm planning theory. We present a national scale conservation framework for selecting protected areas using a case study of Papua New Guinea (PNG) that integrates multiple systems and ecological connectivity to account for cross-realm benefits and minimize threats of land-use and climate change. The relative importance of both the forests and inshore reef environments to PNG subsistence and commercial livelihoods emphasizes the importance of considering the connections between the land and sea. The plan was commissioned by the PNG Conservation and Environment Protection Authority and identifies a comprehensive set of priorities that meet conservation targets in both the land and sea. Our national-scale prioritization framework is useful for agencies and managers looking to implement actions given multiple objectives, including watershed management and biodiversity protection, and ensures actions are efficient and effective across the land and sea.","[Tulloch, Vivitskaia J.

Though we often see it as a contemporary pro-blem, engineering the interface of science and decision-making bodies has been a question since the founding of ecology. This study traces the creation of new conservation initiatives via the repeated splintering of the Ecological Society of America since the early 1900s and compares these against the results of a network analysis of contemporary scientists and their affiliations. Notwithstanding the new terminology of science-policy interfaces, brokers, and gaps, these questions often hinge on the same dilemmas as they did at the beginning of 20th century. The history of these groups shows how divisive distinctions between ecology and conservation, pure and applied research, science and politics, and facts versus values can quickly become integrated into the structure of organizations-even those that are created specifically to bridge gaps in what today would be called the science-policy interface. Meanwhile, a social network analysis of present-day scientists suggests that individual researchers are finding ways to informally jump across science-policy gaps at a sub-organizational level. Remarkably, these science-policy conflicts can pose major problems for organizations, even when the actual activities of members traverse these boundaries on an individual basis. When designing science policy interfaces, formal bridging mechanisms between organizations remain important but these should also support the ongoing, if under-the-radar, ways that individuals negotiate gaps between conservation research and policy advocacy.","[Nyssa, Zoe] Purdue Univ, Dept Anthropol, Stone Hall Suite 219700 W, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA",znyssa@purdue.edu,46,0,0,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",1462-9011,ENVIRON SCI POLICY,Environ.

Ecological effects models are increasingly used to prioritize these efforts at the landscape-scale based on simulated treatment outcomes. Objectives Treatments are often simulated using uniform post-treatment target conditions or proportional changes to baseline forest structure variables, but do not account for the common objective of restoration to mimic the complex forest structure that was present historically which is thought to provide an example of structural conditions that contributed to ecosystem diversity and resilience. Methods We simulate spatially homogenous fire hazard reduction treatments along with heterogeneous restoration treatments in dry conifer forests to investigate how spatial complexity affects ecological indicators of (1) forest structural heterogeneity, (2) forest and watershed vulnerability to high-severity fire, and (3) feasibility of future prescribed fire use. Results Our results suggest that spatially explicit restoration treatments should produce similar wildfire and prescribed fire outcomes as homogeneous fuels reduction treatments, but with greater forest structural heterogeneity. The lack of strong tradeoffs between ecological objectives suggests the primary benefit of spatially complex treatments is to increase forest structural heterogeneity which may promote biodiversity. Conclusions We show that landscape-scale prioritization to maximize ecological benefits can change when spatially complex restoration treatments are modeled. Coupling landscape-scale management simulations and ecological effects models offers flexible decision support for conservation assessment, prioritization, and planning.","[Cannon, Jeffery B.] Jones Ctr Ichauway, Newton, GA 39870 USA; [Gannon, Benjamin M.] Colorado State Univ, Colorado Forest Restorat Inst, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Gannon, Benjamin M.] Colorado State Univ, Dept Forest & Rangeland Stewardship, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Feinstein, Jonas A.] Nat Resources Conservat Serv, USDA, Denver, CO 80225 USA; [Padley, Eunice A.] Nat Resources Conservat Serv, USDA, Washington, DC 20250 USA; [Metz, Loretta J.] Nat Resources Conservat Serv, Resource Inventory & Assessment Div, USDA, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA",jbcannon.pubs@gmail.com,78,6,6,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-2973,LANDSCAPE ECOL,Landsc.

Conferences are important for professional learning and for building academics' reputations and networks. All members of the scientific community should feel supported and free to contribute their best at such events. I evaluated the actions and policies of conferences held by international academic societies for ecology and conservation since 2009, to assess whether conferences support participation across sexual orientations and gender identities. Although half of the 30 conferences had codes of conduct promoting equity, diversity and inclusion, the quantity and quality of initiatives to support such principles varied between societies and years. Conferences with codes were significantly more likely to implement structural initiatives to minimize discrimination or harassment, such as procedures for reporting misconduct and submission guidelines to promote speaker diversity, as well as initiatives to support parents. Initiatives minimizing barriers to attendance were rare; 47% of conferences were held in locations that discriminate against certain identities and <10% promoted event safety and accessibility to potential attendees. Piecemeal actions and inadequate conference evaluation have resulted in no significant growth in gender equity or diversity initiatives. I propose a six-step timeline that improves conference inclusion by embedding diversity and equity into planning, financing, marketing, scientific and social scheduling, evaluation and reporting.","[Tulloch, Ayesha I.

We combined ecological (plant identification, wild fruit availability plots, animal fecal and trace sampling) and social science (free-listing, semi-structured interviews, participant observation) methods to systematically and simultaneously collect data on the availability and selection of fruits from wild plants by humans and critically endangered chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes verus), a national conservation flagship species at Cantanhez National Park, Guinea-Bissau. Within an area of 12.7 km(2), we demonstrate that local people's monthly use of wild fruits was driven by its overall availability in the habitat, whereas chimpanzees, as ripe fruit specialists, sought out fruits year-round. Humans and chimpanzees overlap in the selection of fruits from at least 27 wild plant species. The ranked use of fruits from species which were used by both chimpanzees and humans was significantly positively correlated, suggesting they preferentially target fruits of the same wild plant species. Each month, humans and chimpanzees selected three to six of the same wild fruit species. Chimpanzees fed significantly more on wild fruit species that were available for longer periods, with no effect of that plant species density. Neither plant density nor number of fruiting months impacted human selection of fruit from a plant species, suggesting people might seek out desired resources irrespective of a species' abundance in the landscape. These findings are important for the development of a shared knowledge base to establish culturally relevant conservation management strategies. We recommend the active management of plant species that are exploited for their fruits by both humans and chimpanzees at Cantanhez National Park, including figs (Ficus spp.), oil-palm (Elaeis guineensis) and velvet tamarind (Dialium guineense). This can be achieved through supporting traditional resource management practices and the strategic replanting of shared plants in deforested areas and degraded corridors between forest fragments. This situation is representative of human-chimpanzee coexistence scenarios found across West Africa; the importance of shared resource use should be incorporated into local, national and regional conservation strategies.","[Hockings, Kimberley J.] Univ Exeter, Coll Life & Environm Sci, Ctr Ecol & Conservat, Falmouth, Cornwall, England; [Hockings, Kimberley J.; Parathian, Hannah; Bessa, Joana; Frazao-Moreira, Amelia] NOVA FCSH, Ctr Res Anthropol CRIA, Lisbon, Portugal; [Parathian, Hannah; Frazao-Moreira, Amelia] Univ Nova Lisboa, Fac Social & Human Sci, Dept Anthropol, Lisbon, Portugal; [Bessa, Joana] Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, Oxford, England",k.hockings@exeter.ac.uk,72,7,7,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",2296-701X,FRONT ECOL EVOL,Front.

Ocelots were found mostly in two discrete and disjunct areas: a riverine riparian canyon at just less than 1,000 masl elevation and along arroyos in an oak-mesquite savanna in the Sierra Azul at 1,266-1,406 masl. An ocelot was also detected at a site between those two areas, in an area of a Sonoran desertscrub-foothills thornscrub ecotone at 1,300 mast. At least 18 ocelots, both males and females, were detected during the 2007-2011 and 2014-2018 sampling periods. A female with a kitten was documented in 2011. No individual ocelots were photographed in both areas, which are separated by a minimum of 11.29 km, and no individuals were photographed in both time periods. In a binary logistic regression, key environmental variables predicting ocelot presence were, in order of importance, distance to a paved road, distance to human habitation, proximity to water, and an anthropogenic influences index that was dominated by cattle. Another analysis corroborated the finding regarding ocelot presence and cattle. Contrary to previous studies, ocelot presence was not tied to vegetation cover close to the ground. We present information about the types of habitats and sites ocelots used, short-term movements, daily and seasonal activity patterns, and behavior, including occurrence of different individuals at or near the same site over short periods of time. We discuss ocelot home range, density, and movements, but small sample sizes and study design problems limit the value of estimates derived from our work. Rancho El Aribabi is a private, conservation ranch for which the owners have made voluntary conservation commitments that provide habitat and protection for ocelots and other animals and plants. This northern-most known breeding population is a likely source of ocelots that are periodically detected in southeastern Arizona. Our results should help facilitate conservation of the ocelot in other semi-arid areas of northwestern Mexico and adjacent USA.","[Schipper, Jan] Arizona Ctr Nat Conservat, Phoenix Zoo, South Mt Environm Educ Ctr, Phoenix, AZ USA; [Avila-Villegas, Sergio] Sierra Club, Tucson, AZ USA; [Lamberton-Moreno, Jessica A.] Coalit Sonoran Desert Protect, Tucson, AZ USA; [Flood, Timothy] Friends Arizona Rivers, Phoenix, AZ USA",jrorabaugh@hotmail.com,31,3,3,PEERJ INC,LONDON,"341-345 OLD ST, THIRD FLR, LONDON, EC1V 9LL, ENGLAND",2167-8359,PEERJ,PeerJ,2020,"gold, Green Published",

However, these aims are highly dependent on the efficiency, accuracy and cost of existent methods for the detection of keystone species and monitoring of biological communities. Rapid advances in eDNA, barcoding and metabarcoding promoted by high-throughput sequencing technologies are generating millions of sequences in a fast way, with a promising cost reduction, and overcoming some difficulties of the traditional taxonomic approaches. This paper provides an updated broad perspective of the current developments in this dynamic field presented in the special session (SS) The use of molecular tools in ecological and biodiversity assessment of aquatic ecosystems of the XIX Congress of the Iberian Association of Limnology (AIL2018), held in Coimbra, Portugal. Developments presented are mainly focused on the Iberian Peninsula (Portugal and Spain, including Atlantic Macaronesian islands) but include studies in France, Germany, Finland, Russia (Siberia) and South America. The networks within which these researchers are involved are yet even broader, profiting from existing molecular facilities, and traditional taxonomic expertise, which can be viewed as a characteristic of this new research area. It was evident in the SS that the use of molecular tools is widespread, being used to study a diversity of aquatic systems, from rivers' headwaters to estuaries and coastal lagoons, and volcanic, mountain and frozen lakes to hot springs. The organisms targeted are likewise varied and include fish, macroinvertebrates, meiofauna, microalgae such as diatoms and dinoflagellates, other protists, fungi, and bacteria (cyanobacteria and other). Some studies address the whole biodiversity (i.e., all species present independently of the taxonomic group) from environmental samples of water, biofilms and preservative solution from field samples (e.g., ethanol from macroinvertebrate samples). Great advances were acknowledged in the special session, namely in the use of metabarcoding for detecting hidden biodiversity, juvenile stages, low-abundance species, non-indigenous species and toxicity potential, and ultimately for ecological monitoring of diatoms and invertebrates. Yet, several drawbacks were highlighted and need further work, which include: taxonomic gaps in the reference databases (including gaps at species level and on intraspecific variability) or absence of public databases (e.g. for meiofauna), still high sequencing costs, the need of a substantial bioinformatics effort, difficulties in establishing the amount of environmental sample necessary for a good DNA extraction and the need for testing different genetic markers to obtain accurate results.","[Feio, Maria Joao; Calapez, Ana Raquel] Marine & Environm Sci Ctr MARE, Coimbra, Portugal; [Feio, Maria Joao; Calapez, Ana Raquel] Univ Coimbra, Fac Sci & Technol, Dept Life Sci, Coimbra, Portugal; [Filipe, Ana Filipa; Garcia-Raventos, Aina; Martins, Filipa M.

The management of these populations is further complicated by difficulties in monitoring what are often rare and elusive species. We used local ecological knowledge (LEK) to collect data on the historical and current status of Eurasian otter (Lutra lutra) in Hong Kong as well as determine how local fish farmers and residents perceived management and conservation issues surrounding the species. We found evidence for small population size and decline in numbers and distribution over recent decades for L. lutra. Fish farmers had extensive and familiar experience with otters and expressed largely negative opinions about otter impacts on fish stocks but positive attitudes towards their conservation. However, if otters were to have real or perceived effects on livelihood, then opinions about their conservation were mixed and cautious.

A new local ecological knowledge dataset was obtained through large-scale questionnaire-based interviews with 510 artisanal fishers from 16 coastal fishing communities around Hainan, China. Almost all respondents (92.7%) reported regular encounters with marine mammals. Many respondents reported negative interactions with marine mammals, including bycatch (25.5%), consumption (36.1%), and the sale of meat (9.2%), and respondent perceptions of marine mammals were often negative. Generalized linear models (GLMs) indicated that respondent experiences of marine mammal encounters and bycatch events were mainly predicted by indices of fishing effort and experience, rather than by geographic or socio-economic factors. Respondent experiences of eating or selling marine mammal meat were predicted by geographic location and by some livelihood and socio-economic factors. Respondent perceptions of marine mammals were instead predicted by fishing experience and education level. Classification and regression trees (CARTs) showed that the most important factors determining respondent experiences and perceptions were number of fishing years and educational level, respectively. Both GLMs and CARTs indicated the complex effects of geographic, livelihood, and socio-economic factors on respondent experiences and perceptions of marine mammals. Regional community-based conservation of marine mammals could be promoted through improved regulatory management and environmental education, sustainable ecological exploitation and economic development, and positive partnerships and collaboration between fishing communities, enforcement agencies, and researchers.","[Liu, Mingming; Lin, Mingli; Li, Songhai] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Deep Sea Sci & Engn, Marine Mammal & Marine Bioacoust Lab, Sanya 572000, Peoples R China; [Liu, Mingming] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Turvey, Samuel T.] Zool Soc London, Inst Zool, London, England; [Li, Songhai] Qingdao Natl Lab Marine Sci & Technol, Funct Lab Marine Fisheries Sci & Food Prod Proc, Qingdao, Shandong, Peoples R China; [Li, Songhai] Natl Univ Singapore, Trop Marine Sci Inst, Singapore, Singapore",lish@idsse.ac.cn,54,2,2,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1052-7613,AQUAT CONSERV,Aquat.

Current strategies involving protected areas are predominantly fixed in space, and may on their own be inadequate under climate change. Here, we propose a novel approach to climate adaptation that combines permanent protected areas with temporary conservation areas to create flexible networks. Previous work has tended to consider permanent and dynamic protection as separate actions, but their integration could draw on the strengths of both approaches to improve biodiversity conservation and help manage for ecological uncertainty in the coming decades. As there are often time lags in the establishment of new permanent protected areas, the inclusion of dynamic conservation areas within permanent networks could provide critical transient protection to mitigate land-use changes and biodiversity redistributions. This integrated approach may be particularly useful in highly human-modified and fragmented landscapes where areas of conservation value are limited and long-term place-based protection is unfeasible. To determine when such an approach may be feasible, we propose the use of a decision framework. Under certain scenarios, these coupled networks have the potential to increase spatio-temporal network connectivity and help maintain biodiversity and ecological processes under climate change. Implementing these networks would require multidisciplinary scientific evidence, new policies, creative funding solutions, and broader acceptance of a dynamic approach to biodiversity conservation.","[D'Aloia, Cassidy C.] Univ New Brunswick, Dept Biol Sci, St John, NB, Canada; [D'Aloia, Cassidy C.; Blackford, Christopher; Darling, Emily; Xuereb, Amanda; Fortin, Marie-Josee] Univ Toronto, Dept Ecol Evolutionary Biol, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Naujokaitis-Lewis, Ilona] Carleton Univ, Environm & Climate Change Canada, Natl Wildlife Res Ctr, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Chu, Cindy] Ontario Minist Nat Resources & Forestry, Aquat Res & Monitoring Sect, Peterborough, ON, Canada; [Curtis, Janelle M.

However, modeling papers regarding real-world conservation issues are scarce. Here, we combined two modeling tools to identify priority areas in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, focusing on the last large-bodied frugivorous bird in the region, the red-billed curassow (Crax blumenbachii). We used population viability analysis (PVA) to determine (1) the minimum viable population size under different hunting scenarios; and (2) the minimum critical forest patch size required to maintain viable populations. We used ecological niche modeling (ENM) to identify remnants that retain suitable environmental conditions to ensure the long-term persistence of this species. We overlapped the outputs from PVA and ENM models to identify priority areas for curassows. Under our best-case scenario, 56 individuals would suffice to maintain a viable population and 71 forest patches located within the species' known range are above the critical size of 3141 ha. In the worst-case scenario, at least 138 individuals would be required to maintain a viable population in forest patches larger than 9500 ha, corresponding to only 20 Atlantic Forest fragments within the species range. Among these, 17 presented median habitat suitability values higher than 0.70, eight of which were selected as priority areas for law enforcement and nine as priority areas for reintroduction. We encourage conservation biologists and land managers to combine modeling tools which can be guided by our conservation planning framework. This approach is promising to inform long-term conservation planning of a flagship species and its entire ecosystem. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.","[Bonfim, Fernando C.

In particular, sawfishes are susceptible to myriad fisheries that operate in the same regions. Unfortunately, these well-documented threats can be only partly mitigated because of ongoing human resource needs. However, the outlook for sawfishes is optimistic if we build on 5 successful research and conservation approaches developed over the past 2 decades: (1) local ecological knowledge, (2) identification of nurseries, (3) state-of-the-art techniques, (4) tagging studies, and (5) threat mitigation. If appreciation of healthy ecosystems that contain top predators like sawfishes can be fostered by healthy human populations where sawfishes occur (e.g. ecosystem management, promotion of sustainable livelihoods), and if local knowledge can be used to influence scientific studies that inform customized management decisions, this group of iconic species will have a chance to recover. In addition, promoting sample collection, sample archiving, and collaboration, especially in instances of sawfish mortality, will maximize the knowledge gained, despite often limited funding and limited samples. The first 2 decades of the 21st century have seen the first steps taken toward sawfish recovery, but there is more to do. Ultimately, translation of research results into conservation actions that include enforcement and fisher behavior change will be the key to sustained recovery. This Overview provides a context for the papers in the Theme Section 'Biology and ecology of sawfishes', and we incorporate them as part of a mini-review of research on this threatened group to provide a future outlook.","[Poulakis, Gregg R.] Florida Fish & Wildlife Conservat Commiss, Charlotte Harbor Field Lab, Fish & Wildlife Res Inst, Port Charlotte, FL 33954 USA; [Grubbs, R.

Here, biodiversity was valued using an ecological approach based on the intrinsic value incorporated in biodiversity per se, regardless of any human association. The Marine Biological Valuation protocol was drawn upon the methodology of terrestrial valuation maps, to support the European MSFD environmental status assessment (descriptor 1 - biodiversity) and national marine spatial planning approaches. To apply the protocol on the Portuguese continental shelf we compiled and analyzed national biological databases for a wide taxonomic range of ecosystem components (seabirds, demersal fish, macrobenthos, marine mammals and sea turtles) and assessed the spatial overlap with existing and proposed conservation areas (Natura 2000 network). The resultant maps described patterns of biological value consistent with the physical and biological oceanographic conditions as well as local hydrodynamics of the Portuguese continental shelf. The results of our approach confirm previously identified valuable areas for protection (particularly in the northern and central regions), but also highlights the value of currently unprotected sites, mainly in the southern region. Biological valuation maps showed to be comprehensive tool to compile and spatially analyze biological datasets. By drawing attention to subzones of biological importance, it constitutes a valuable instrument in making appropriate-scale decisions on the spatial allocation of human activities in the context of the Portuguese marine spatial planning, currently facing the pressure and impacts of increased maritime exploitation.","[Gomes, Ines; Bueno-Pardo, Juan; Quintino, Victor; Rodrigues, Ana Maria; Queiroga, Henrique] Univ Aveiro, Dept Biol, Campus Univ Santiago, P-3810193 Aveiro, Portugal; [Gomes, Ines; Bueno-Pardo, Juan; Quintino, Victor; Rodrigues, Ana Maria; Queiroga, Henrique] Univ Aveiro, CESAM, Campus Univ Santiago, P-3810193 Aveiro, Portugal; [Gomes, Ines; Vanreusel, Ann] Univ Ghent, Marine Biol Res Grp, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Perez-Jorge, Sergi] Univ Azores, MARE Marine & Environm Sci Ctr, P-9901862 Horta, Portugal; [Perez-Jorge, Sergi] Univ Azores, Inst Marine Res IMAR, P-9901862 Horta, Portugal; [Peteiro, Laura] Univ Vigo, Dept Ecol & Biol Anim, Fac Ciencias Mar, Vigo 36310, Spain; [Andrade, Joana] SPEA, P-1070062 Lisbon, Portugal; [Azevedo, Manuela] IPMA, P-1495006 Lisbon, Portugal; [Deneudt, Klaas] Flanders Marine Inst VLIZ, InnovOcean Site, B-8400 Oostende, Belgium",istgomes@gmail.com,87,6,6,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1470-160X,ECOL INDIC,Ecol.

Owing to resource stewardship practice over millennia, Indigenous nations possess Indigenous knowledge that positions them as leaders in contemporary resource management. However, Indigenous peoples possibly face social-ecological traps, situations in which feedbacks between social and ecological systems result in an undesirable state, that are challenging to overcome. Centuries of compounding colonization and environmental degradation have negatively impacted Indigenous knowledge and culturally mediated stewardship practices. Our partnership, comprising academics and four First Nations on the Central Coast of British Columbia, Canada, mobilized information from semistructured interviews with knowledge holders to explore Indigenous knowledge of a culturally important but vulnerable species, yelloweye rockfish (Sebastes ruberrimus). We analyzed interviews and discovered evidence of an extant but transcendable social-ecological trap. The emergent themes represent an exploration beyond our original project goals and research questions. Our study revealed that external forces of colonization, i.e., via forced assimilation, and species declines created a social-ecological trap. However, participants ubiquitously described stewardship principles, and noted ongoing cultural revitalization efforts, active recovery of depleted species, and reassertion of Indigenous management rights as ways they are rebelling against, and overcoming, the trap. Although the framing of a social-ecological trap may be perceived as diminishing the authority of Indigenous governance systems, we found the opposite to be true. Despite external pressures, coastal First Nations are reasserting cultural and management rights and shaping their futures. We suggest that ongoing Indigenous cultural renewal and ecosystem recovery in the face of the historically entrenched trap be supported through recognizing and implementing inherent Indigenous marine management rights. The social-ecological trap described here differs from others in the literature in that the creation of the trap was external; moving beyond it is happening through internal, i.e., led by the First Nations, efforts.","[Eckert, Lauren E.] Univ Victoria, Dept Geog, Victoria, BC, Canada; [Ban, Natalie C.; Turner, Nancy] Univ Victoria, Sch Environm Studies, Victoria, BC, Canada; [Tallio, Snxakila-Clyde] Nuxalk Nation, Ancestral Governance Project, Bella Coola, BC, Canada",,65,16,16,RESILIENCE ALLIANCE,WOLFVILLE,"ACADIA UNIV, BIOLOGY DEPT, WOLFVILLE, NS B0P 1X0, CANADA",1708-3087,ECOL SOC,Ecol.

These maps are constructed from modeling species ecological niches based on the association between the geographical localities where species were detected and the environmental variables at those localities. Previous researches addressed the development of MPB for administrative regions using regional species distributions data to modeling ecological niches, which may lead to flawed predictions on potential biodiversity. Our aim is to assess the consequences of failing to include all available records on full species distribution to develop MPB. As a study case, we produced two MPBs for an administrative region of Argentina using RSD and FSD data sets of 14 species of insects and performed Environmental Niche Factor Analysis to model their ecological niches. Our results evidenced that both MPB were not spatially congruent in their predictions on potential biodiversity, because the ecological niches represented by RSD and FSD data were different in their position and volume. We found that the MPB based on RSD data may underpredict the potential biodiversity of distinct habitats at the landscape level, and that the use of this map may underestimate areas with different conservation potential within an administrative region. These results suggest that the choice of the extent of geographic records used to construct the MPB strongly conditions the quality and credibility of these maps.","[Carrara, Rodolfo; Roig-Junent, Sergio Alberto] Inst Argentino Invest Zonas Aridas IADIZA, Ctr Cientif Tecnol CONICET Mendoza, Lab Entomol, Casilla Correo 507, RA-5500 Mendoza, Argentina",rcarrara@mendoza-conicet.gob.ar,45,0,0,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0960-3115,BIODIVERS CONSERV,Biodivers.

It looks at how facilitating enhanced usage of cultural ecosystem services may mobilize ecological identities - or one's identification as a responsible agent to a natural system. The study focuses on the village groves of Korea that were restored during the first phase of the village grove restoration program (2003-2015) led by Korea Forest Service (KFS). Questionnaire survey was used to collect data on village leaders' ecological identity values (EIV) and their perception of how village groves' different ecosystem services are being used by villagers and non-villagers. These data were complemented by KFS-published information regarding the village groves' social-ecological system factors. Government documents and independent evaluation reports were analyzed to understand specifically how the restoration program addressed the task of restoring cultural values. Relationship between EIV and ecosystem service usage levels were examined by linear regression analysis, while difference tests were conducted to infer whether or not select social-ecological factors exhibit distinct difference in EIV or in ecosystem service usage levels. While the analytical results are far from conclusive, they hint at certain directions: first, the restoration program is found to have treated village groves themselves to be embodiments of cultural values. This approach leaves a wide gap to effective revival or reinvention of specific cultural uses or values that users can associate with. Second, the regression analysis shows generally stronger influence on village leaders' EIV by cultural ecosystem service usage than by usage of other service types. Examining by subtypes of cultural ecosystem services, those that are villager-oriented compared to visitor-oriented show higher influence on EIV, as do those individually-used compared to collectively-used. Third, the difference tests show no conclusive results about social-ecological system factors, except to speculate that factors conducive to visitor-oriented uses are found associated with lower EIV in village leaders. Furthermore, tourism attraction presence shows not only association with lower EIV but also with generally lower usage of the village groves' varoius ecosystem services. Such findings that show distinctions between villager-oriented andvisitor-oriented services and uses of village groves call for deliberative balancing of possible trade-offs between benefits to different user groups. This seminal study calls for further research on ecological identities, cultural values and cultural ecosystem services as potentially useful approaches to achieve more sustainable and equitable outcomes in restoration and conservation efforts.","[Heejoo, Lee] Seoul Natl Univ, Res Inst Agr & Life Sci, Bldg 200,Room 7215,1 Gwanak Ro, Seoul, South Korea; [Yeo-Chang, Youn] Inst Sustainable Social Ecol Syst, 22-8 Seongsu Dong 1 Ga, Seoul, South Korea; [Yeo-Chang, Youn] Seoul Sch Integrated Sci & Technol, 6 Ewhayeodae 2 Gil,Fintower, Seoul 03767, South Korea",bokkee@snu.ac.kr; youn@snu.ac.kr,54,0,0,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0378-1127,FOREST ECOL MANAG,For.

However, with the ability to provide fine-scale spatial data (tens to hundreds of meters, depending on array setup and receiver range) at a low cost, acoustic telemetry presents an important tool for obtaining key information on marine turtle ecology. We present a comprehensive and systematic review acknowledging how acoustic telemetry has been used to advance the field of marine turtle ecology and conservation. We identify the extent of current studies and discuss common and novel research approaches while addressing specific limitations of acoustic telemetry. Forty-eight studies were reviewed, representing six of the seven marine turtle species and all life stages, with most individuals identified as juveniles (45%) and hatchlings (36%). Most studies (83%) focused on the spatial distribution of marine turtles, including estimating home ranges, investigating drivers of habitat use, and identifying horizontal movement patterns and vertical space use. Additionally, acoustic telemetry has been used to study hatchling dispersal and marine turtle exposure and response to threats, as well as to monitor physiological parameters. We identified that acoustic telemetry directly or indirectly informs 60% of the top questions and research priorities related to marine turtles identified by experts in the field. With an increase in acoustic telemetry receiver networks and collaborations across taxa, the applicability of acoustic telemetry is growing, not only for marine turtles but for a wide array of marine species. Although there are limitations that need to be considered at a site/project-level, acoustic telemetry is an important, low-cost technology able to address key questions related to marine turtle ecology that can aid in their conservation, and therefore should be considered by researchers as they develop their projects.","[Hardin, Emily E.; Fuentes, Mariana M.

To discuss the model of urban ecological life, this paper focused on Satoyama landscapes and reviewed academic articles on the existing cases of Satoyama conservation by urban residents in the Greater Tokyo Area. We analyzed activities performed by participants, benefits to participants, and targeted and achieved ecosystems. Several findings were obtained from the review of published literature. First, the participants were mainly elderly men aged 60 years or older, who were not necessarily local people and who were motivated mostly by the need to conserve nature and improve their health. People with intellectual disabilities also enjoyed the benefits of Satoyama woodland management. Second, participants tended to recognize benefits in terms of health promotion, social cohesion, recreation, and resource utilization, rather than landscape and biodiversity conservation. Third, there were different directions of Satoyama conservation from the perspectives of nature and humans. The broader ecosystem beyond each site was not necessarily considered in Satoyama conservation. These findings show the potential of, and the necessity for, attracting other urban residents by including various activities that consist of not only vegetation conservation but also communal events based on different preferences. There is also a need for balancing environmental and socio-economic perspectives, and the targeted ecosystem should be further explored in collaboration with experts in ecology and landscape planning to make urban ecological life feasible.","[Shimpo, Naomi] Univ Tsukuba, 1-1-1 Tennodai, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058572, Japan; [Shimpo, Naomi] Univ Hyogo, 954-2 Nojimatokiwa, Awaji, Hyogo 6561726, Japan",naomi_shimpo@awaji.ac.jp,65,0,0,SPRINGER JAPAN KK,TOKYO,"SHIROYAMA TRUST TOWER 5F, 4-3-1 TORANOMON, MINATO-KU, TOKYO, 105-6005, JAPAN",1860-1871,LANDSC ECOL ENG,Landsc.

We interviewed 96 household heads from seven communities to obtain their socioeconomic data and WTA values. Additionally, we used data from a plant inventory to gather information on species abundance. We found that the selected socioeconomic variables are a poor predictor of the WTA values. Our findings also demonstrate that women accept lower WTA values to not use some species. Additionally, individuals from bigger families accept lower WTA values to not use just one of the plant species. Species abundance did not influence informants' WTA values. Generally, informants overestimated bids, which may hinder biodiversity conservation. Socioeconomic and ecological factors may not have an influence on WTA values in communities that inhabit protected areas.","[Laurentino, Marcelanio] Univ Fed Rural Pernambuco, Dept Biol, Programa Posgrad Bot, Rua Dom Manoel Medeiros S-N, BR-52171900 Dois Irmaos, PE, Brazil; [de Lima Araujo, Elcida] Univ Fed Pernambuco, Dept Bot, Av Prof Moraes Rego,1235,Cidade Univ, BR-50670901 Recife, PE, Brazil; [Ramos, Marcelo Alves] Univ Pernambuco, Lab Estudos Etnobiol, BR-55800000 Nazare Da Mata, PE, Brazil; [Laurentino, Marcelanio; Cavalcanti, Maria Clara Bezerra Tenorio; Goncalves, Paulo Henrique Santos; Albuquerque, Ulysses Paulino] Univ Fed Pernambuco, Dept Bot, Lab Ecol & Evolucao Sistemas Socioecol LEA, Av Prof Moraes Rego 1235, BR-50670901 Recife, PE, Brazil",upa677@hotmail.com,59,0,0,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1387-585X,ENVIRON DEV SUSTAIN,Environ.

Many assumptions used to interpret glucocorticoid results are derived from biomedical data on humans or laboratory rodents, but these assumptions often fail for wild animals under field conditions. We discuss five common assumptions often made about glucocorticoids in ecological and conservation research that are not generally supported by the literature. (1) High acute elevations of glucocorticoids indicate an animal in distress. In fact: because glucocorticoids are needed to survive stressors, elevated concentrations often reflect adequate coping. (2) Low glucocorticoid concentrations indicate a healthy animal. In fact: because glucocorticoids are important in responding to stressors, low glucocorticoid concentrations might indicate the lack of adequate coping. (3) Sustained elevated glucocorticoids indicate chronically stressed animals. In fact: glucocorticoid concentrations by themselves have no predictive value in diagnosing chronic stress. (4) Glucocorticoids mobilize energy to survive short-term stressors such as predator attacks. In fact: glucocorticoids' primary impact on energy regulation is to remove glucose transporters from cell surfaces. Not only is this process too slow to provide short-term energy, but glucocorticoid-induced increases in glucose reflect decreased, not increased, glucose utilization. (5) Glucocorticoid measurements in non-blood tissues (e.g., feces, hair, feathers, etc.) are equivalent to blood concentrations. In fact: these alternative tissues present imperfect reflections of blood concentrations, and it is blood concentrations that interact with receptors to evoke biological change. In summary, proper consideration of these common assumptions will greatly aid in interpreting glucocorticoid data from ecological and conservation studies.","[Romero, L.

They are valued for food, pollination, and trade though their habitat preference and distribution is different in Sindh province of Pakistan. Their current conservation status was also needed to be confirmed, therefore we aimed to record their diversity, ecological conditions as well as their conservation through surveys in different types of habitats from sun rise to sun set. The species of pigeons: Columba livia (rock pigeon), Columba livia domestica (domestic pigeon), and Columba leuconota (snow pigeon) were found from the study area along with doves including Streptopelia decaocto (Eurasian collared dove) and Streptopelia risoria (barbary dove). It was recorded that pigeon's most preferred habitat was urban areas followed by suburban areas, however dove population was denser in agricultural areas. Roosting and nesting sites were observed in wide variety of human habitations especially in brick or stone buildings. C. livia, was recorded as most abundant species of genus Columba, however C. leuconota, was observed very rare in study area roosting on cliffs. Population density of doves was recorded lower than that of the pigeons and they were often recorded in agricultural areas where their nests were sighted often on trees. Urban areas provide shelter to pigeons and doves where they maintain ecological conditions balanced by controlling pest insects. It was also determined that pigeons and doves are vulnerable due to hunting and illegal trade in the study area.","[Sirhandi, Bibi Abida; Shaikh, Kalsoom; Rashidi, Sahibzado Farmanullah; Shabrani, Waheed Ahmed; Arain, Iqra; Arain, Misbah; Gachal, Ghulam Sarwar; Raees, Iqra; Lakho, Hira; Rajput, Khalid Saifullah; Shaikh, Abdul Rehman] Univ Sindh, Dept Zool, Jamshoro, Pakistan",kalsoom.shaikh@usindh.edu.pk,12,0,0,HEALTH & ENVIRONMENT ASSOC,TIRANE,"HEALTH & ENVIRONMENT ASSOC, TIRANE, 00000, ALBANIA",2224-4980,INT J ECOSYST ECOL S,Int.

Particularly Warm Temperate Province of the Northeast Pacific (WTPNP) includes priority conservation areas, but records of endemic marine species are limited, their distributions remains generally unknown, and often excluded in extant conservation plans. Within the WTPNP, the Balandra Protected Natural Area (BPNA) is located within La Paz Bay, and it is the only management area with a developed plan. However, marine endemic fish species have not been fully considering, and their protection status requires a re-evaluation, particularly the distribution of species with adequate spatial resolution. Despite the scarce information on marine endemic fishes, ecological niche modelling allows predicting distribution areas through occurrences of the species and their relationship with a set of scenopoetic environmental variables. The abiotically suitable areas based of the endemic marine fish species within the WTPNP documented within the Bay of La Paz were modeled and the high-value areas for conservation were established through a multi-species models; these spatial patterns of suitable areas were contrasted with the current state of fish protection. Modelling was performed with the Maxent software supplied with presence-only data of 18 species and four sets of environmental layers related to the geomorphology and bottom sedimentology, as well as the Euclidean distance measures from mangrove and rocky shore habitats. We generated sixteen distribution models that revealed that only 8.4 % of the predicted area, on average, was located within a maximum state of protection within the BPNA core zone. Moreover, the generated multi-species model reveals that only 17 % of the high-value areas (? 9 species/hectare) were located in the core zone. These high-value areas indicate updating the current management program is required. Finally, the study illustrates how the predicted-areas can be linked to conservation strategies in the marine habitat space within and outside the BPNA.","[Urcadiz-Cazares, Francisco J.] Tecnol Nacl Mexico, Dept Ciencias Basicas, Campus La Paz, La Paz 23080, Baja Calif Sur, Mexico; [Urcadiz-Cazares, Francisco J.; Ortega-Rubio, Alfredo] Ctr Invest Biol Noroeste Planeac Ambiental & Cons, Ave Inst Politecn Nacl 195, La Paz 23090, Baja Calif Sur, Mexico; [Cruz-Escalona, Victor Hugo; Gonzalez-Acosta, Adrian F.; Martinez-Flores, Guillermo; Hernandez-Carmona, Gustavo H.; Del Pino-Machado, Arturo] Inst Politecn Nacl, Ctr Interdisciplinario Ciencias Marinas, Ave Inst Politecn Nacl S-N,Postal Box 592, La Paz 23096, Baja Calif Sur, Mexico; [Peterson, Mark S.] Univ Southern Mississippi, Sch Ocean Sci & Engn, Div Coastal Sci, 703 East Beach Dr, Ocean Springs, MS 39564 USA; [Marin-Enriquez, Emigdio] Univ Autonoma Sinaloa, CONACYT Fac Ciencias Mar, Paseo Claussen S-N, Mazatlan 8200, Sinaloa, Mexico; [Aguilar-Medrano, Rosalia] CINVESTAV Merida, Lab Taxon & Ecol Peces, Dept Recursos Mar, Km 6 Antigua Carretera Progreso, Merida 97310, Yucatan, Mexico",vescalon@ipn.mx,71,1,1,ELSEVIER GMBH,MUNICH,"HACKERBRUCKE 6, 80335 MUNICH, GERMANY",1617-1381,J NAT CONSERV,J.

FQA is based on coefficients of conservatism (C-values). C-values are regional, expert-assigned values, which range from 0 to 10 to reflect a taxon's fidelity to high quality natural areas and its relative tolerance to modern human impacts. Approximately half of FQA publications assert without evidence that plant species with lower C-values are more generalist, whereas species with higher C-values are habitat specialists. The connection between specialization and C-values has never been investigated. Our primary objective was to test the claim that ecological specialization is associated with C-values. We first used the theta (theta) method, based on species co-occurrences, to estimate niche width for 274 species in 598 wetlands, grasslands, and forests in Illinois, USA. As a secondary proxy for niche width, we counted the habitat preferences of all Illinois vascular taxa listed from the Illinois Plant Information Network (ILPIN). For theta in grasslands and wetlands, and for ILPIN habitat counts, the lowest and highest C-values were associated with greater ecological specialization, whereas species with low to intermediate C-values were the most generalist. In forests, we found weaker, negatively linear relationships between C-values and theta, indicating that species with a high conservation value (i. e. conservative) were the most specialized. However, when shrub and canopy layers were combined with the herbaceous layer data in forests, we did not find an association between C-values and specialization. We also reanalyzed the data to determine the effect of non-native species on the relationship between niche width and C-values because non-native species, by default, receive C-values of 0. Removing non-native species from the analyses did not influence our conclusions. Both methods to measure specialization suggested there is a weak relationship between C-values and ecological specialization. Our findings support the common claim that some conservative species are more specialized than species with intermediate or low C-values. However, we found the general C-value and specialization relationship is more complex than assumed by many FQA publications because if it exists, it is not necessarily linear, i.e., species with low C-values are often specialists. Specialization and niche width could be latent components of C-values, but FQA users should avoid defining species conservatism by niche and specialization.","[Zinnen, Jack; Matthews, Jeffrey W.] Univ Illinois, Dept Nat Resources & Environm Sci, 1102 S Goodwin Ave, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Spyreas, Greg; Zaya, David N.] Univ Illinois, Illinois Nat Hist Survey, 1816 S Oak St, Champaign, IL 61820 USA",jzinnen2@illinois.edu,59,1,1,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1470-160X,ECOL INDIC,Ecol.

Fragments stranded within cities are especially stress-prone due to their greatly altered environment and high human impacts. We review biodiversity and ecological studies from Bukit Timah, a tropical forest fragment in Singapore, to ask how this forest has contributed to our understanding of tropical ecology and fragmentation effects, and list the conservation values of this forest. Evidence from Amazonian fragments predicts that losses in diversity and forest function follow fragmentation, and although Bukit Timah has adhered to some of those predictions, other aspects of the forest appeared remarkably resilient. As might be expected, declines in plant, invertebrate, bird, and mammal diversity occurred not only historically but also across two surveys made about 20 years apart. In other ways Bukit Timah proved surprising. Aboveground biomass fluctuated but did not plummet drastically, and was comparable to levels found in primary forests in the region. The extirpation of large fauna did not appear to reduce the dispersal of large seeded plant species, likely due to continued dispersal by small-mammals and birds. Exotic tree species are confined to recovering secondary forest fringes and do not threaten the primary forest, except for perhaps shade tolerant Par ' a rubber and a handful of cultivated fruit trees. Studies of birds and plants found that life history differences could account for differences in genetic connectivity or isolation for different species, with population genetic implications for other taxa. Despite being a small fragment, new species of plants and animals continue to be discovered or re-discovered. Clearly, there are reasons to celebrate Bukit Timah as a forest fragment that withstood two centuries of human impacts. Nonetheless, many measures can be implemented to better secure its future.","[Lum, Shawn; Min, Ngo Kang] Nanyang Technol Univ, Asian Sch Environm, Singapore, Singapore",shawn.lum@ntu.edu.sg,89,0,0,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0006-3207,BIOL CONSERV,Biol.

Thirteen species in cerrados and four in carrascos were indicated as conservation priorities.

Addressing this lack of knowledge will be essential to aid the effective implementation of targeted conservation measures. Here, we use ensemble ecological niche modeling to predict the monthly distribution of manta rays in the WCA using multiple sources of species occurrence data, and consequently identify core areas, which represent suitable habitat in all months of the year. Models suggest a seasonal cycle of expansion and contraction of suitable habitat from coastal areas in spring-summer, to open ocean in autumn-winter. Core areas are concentrated along the coast of the USA, Mexico, and Venezuela. Only 24% of predicted suitable habitat is encompassed by the present regional network of MPAs, and is intersected by numerous, heavily trafficked shipping lanes. Manta rays are slow-growing animals that only produce a limited number of offspring; as such, this species is sensitive to even moderate increases in mortality rates. For this reason, the existing regional network of MPAs may offer them limited protection. As manta rays in the WCA are challenged by a complex landscape of threats and protective measures, future marine conservation planning in the region should explicitly address the conservation of manta rays, focusing on areas identified as key habitats for the species.","[Garzon, F.] MarAlliance, Sal Rei, Cape Verde; [Garzon, F.; Witt, M.

Most traditional aquaculture programs negatively affect ecological performance, genetic, and phenotypic diversity of hatchery-origin fish compared with wild counterparts. Here, we synthesize outcomes of three conservation programs aimed at enhancing 'wildness'. Each program focuses on a different species: lake sturgeon, razorback sucker, and Rio Grande silvery minnow. These species differ in key life history traits including size and age at sexual maturity, reproductive and migratory behavior, and habitat requirements. Threats to persistence of the focal taxa, however, exemplify common pressures experienced by freshwater fishes worldwide. Conservation hatchery programs for lake sturgeon, razorback sucker, and Rio Grande silvery minnow capitalize on natural spawning in the wild followed by collections of wild-fertilized eggs/larvae for hatchery rearing. Individuals are repatriated to the wild after rearing to body sizes less susceptible to mortality. Protocols include collections of eggs or larvae across the entire spawning period and at appropriate geographic scales to maximize retention of genetic diversity and, to increase the likelihood of preserving variation for heritable life history traits. Using direct and indirect evidence we show that hatchery programs that allow individuals to fulfill parts of the life-cycle in their native habitats can be conducted without compromising genetic diversity. Adoption of similar strategies in other imperiled fishes would improve understanding of species life history, and provide an incentive to protect native habitats so they may eventually support self-sustaining populations.","[Osborne, Megan J.; Turner, Thomas F.] 1 Univ New Mexico, Dept Biol, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA; [Osborne, Megan J.; Turner, Thomas F.] 1 Univ New Mexico, Museum Southwestern Biol, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA; [Dowling, Thomas E.] Wayne State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Detroit, MI 48202 USA; [Scribner, Kim T.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Fisheries & Wildlife, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Scribner, Kim T.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Integrat Biol, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA",mosborne@unm.edu; thomas.dowling@wayne.edu; scribne3@msu.edu; turnert@unm.edu,141,2,2,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0006-3207,BIOL CONSERV,Biol.

However, in their land-use decisions, farmers are often challenged with balancing biodiversity maintenance and profit generation. Under the current agricultural system, this tends to result in intensive farming which destroys suitable habitat for wild species. Thus, the potential for land-use conflicts between agriculture and biological conservation is high. Previous studies that investigated the effects of subsidies and taxes suggest mild trade-offs between conservation and farming, thus favouring land-sharing solutions to biological conservation. However, many ecological-economic models that dealt with this issue neglect possible Allee effects, which have been found by ecologists to be a common phenomenon. The existence of Allee effects markedly alters predictions of ecological-economic models: we show that conservation success is accompanied by substantial losses in agricultural production. More suitable habitat is required to prevent extinction of the species of interest, and conservation measures should start before the population has declined to some critical value. We emphasize the effect of spatial fragmentation on population viability under an Allee effect, as a clumped area of suitable habitat protects a population much better from extinction than a fragmented mosaic of habitat patches.","[Vortkamp, Irina; Hilker, Frank M.] Osnabruck Univ, Inst Environm Syst Res, D-49076 Osnabruck, Germany; [Vortkamp, Irina; Hilker, Frank M.] Osnabruck Univ, Inst Math, D-49076 Osnabruck, Germany; [Barraquand, Frederic] Univ Bordeaux, LabEx COTE, Integrat & Theoret Ecol, F-33615 Pessac, France; [Barraquand, Frederic] CNRS, Inst Math Bordeaux, F-33405 Talence, France",irina.vortkamp@uni-osnabrueck.de,57,1,1,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0304-3800,ECOL MODEL,Ecol.

Such continuous study provides a rare opportunity to ask questions that are only answerable through decades-long monitoring of these long-lived monkeys. In turn, the mounting data generated by long-term study, including knowledge of lifetime reproductive success, familial relatedness, comprehensive behavioral and dietary repertoires, and patterns of inter- and intra-annual variation in forest productivity, provide diverse opportunities to researchers, and facilitate studies that are of shorter duration. Here, we review some of the contributions of our longitudinal research on white-faced capuchins and Geoffroy's spider monkeys, together with newer studies on mantled howler monkeys. We begin by synthesizing findings from our research on demography, dispersal, social relationships, and reproduction.

An adaptive approach can refine management recommendations following the outcomes of previous actions or as improved scientific knowledge about a species' ecology becomes available. Following severe population declines the majority of the Swiss European Nightjar (Caprimulgus europaeus)population is now restricted to a small core area in the canton of Valais, despite the local application of evidence-based restoration measures to the breeding habitats. The habitat use of this crepuscular bird species is presumed to be restricted to semi-open oak-pine scrublands and rocky steppe. By deploying miniature GPS loggers we assessed the spatial and habitat selection of 42 individuals (25 individuals in 2018 and 30 individuals in 2019; comprising 13 redeployments between years) in five study sites in the canton Valais. We highlight the importance of using fine-scaled movement data to obtain insight into complex multi-scale habitat requirements of a species. Nightjars used multiple habitats, indicating the importance of complementary resources to breed (e.g. open forest and shrub) and to forage (e.g. semi-extensive grasslands and vineyards). The connectivity between these resources was influenced by habitat configuration and composition. Given these new insights for future conservation strategies, our results also suggest that national-level land use changes, mainly due to agricultural intensification processes, have contributed to the long-term population declines in Switzerland. We therefore consider our result in the context of knowledge gaps for species that exploit complementary habitats and the potential shortcomings for conservation planning on discrete species showing complex ecological requirements.","[Evens, R.; Jacot, A.; Rappaz, L.; Theux, C.; Pradervand, Jean-Nicolas] Swiss Ornithol Inst, Field Stn Valais, Sion, Switzerland; [Evens, R.] Max Planck Inst Ornithol, Dept Behav Ecol & Evolutionary Genet, Eberhard Gwinner Str, D-82319 Seewiesen, Germany; [Artois, T.] Hasselt Univ, Res Grp Zool Biodivers Toxicol & Ecol, Ctr Environm Sci, Diepenbeek, Belgium; [Ulenaers, E.] Agentschap Nat Bos, Brussels, Belgium; [Neyens, T.] Hasselt Univ, Res Grp, Ctr Stat, Ctr Environm Sci, Diepenbeek, Belgium; [Neyens, T.] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Biostat & Stat Bioinformat Ctr, Fac Med Leuven, Leuven, Belgium",ruben.evens@uhasselt.be,73,2,2,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1367-9430,ANIM CONSERV,Anim.

Species distribution models are geospatial tools widely used in the identification and delineation of species' distribution areas and zones susceptible to climate change. The objectives of this study were to: (i) model and quantify the environmentally suitable area for Pinus greggii in Mexico, and possible future distributions under four different scenarios of climate change; (ii) identify the most relevant environmental variables that will possibly drive changes in future distribution; and (iii) to propose adequate zones for the species' conservation in Mexico. Some 438 records of Pinus greggii from several national and international databases were obtained, and duplicates were discarded to avoid overestimations in the models. Climatic, edaphic, and topographic variables were used and 100 distribution models for current and future scenarios were generated using the Maxent software. The best model had an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.88 and 0.93 for model training and validation, respectively, a partial ROC of 1.94, and a significant Z test (p<0.01). The current estimated suitable area of Pinus greggii in Mexico was 617,706.04 ha. The most relevant environmental variables for current distribution were annual mean temperature, mean temperature of coldest quarter, and slope. For the 2041-2060 models, annual mean temperature, precipitation of coldest quarter, and slope were the most important drivers. The use of climatic models allowed to predict a future decrease in suitable habitat for the species by 2041-2060, ranging from 48,403.85 (7.8% - HadGEM2-ES RCP 8.5 model) to 134,680.17 ha (21.8% - CNRM-CM5 RCP 4.5). Spatial modeling of current and future ecological niche of Pinus greggii also allowed to delineate two zones for in situ conservation and restoration purpose in northeastern (Nuevo Leon) and central (Hidalgo) Mexico.","[Martinez-Sifuentes, Aldo R.; Villanueva-Diaz, Jose; Estrada-Avalos, Juan] Inst Nacl Invest Forestales Agr & Pecuarias, Ctr Nacl Invest Disciplinaria Relac Agua, Suelo, Planta,Atmosfera, Durango, Mexico; [Manzanilla-Quinones, Ulises] Univ Autonoma Nuevo Leon, Fac Ciencias Forestales, Linares, Nuevo Leon, Mexico; [Becerra-Lopez, Jorge L.] Univ Juarez Estado Durango, Fac Ciencias Biol, Durango, Mexico; [Hernandez-Herrera, Jose A.] Univ Autonoma Agr Antonio Narro, Unidad Saltillo, Saltillo, Coahuila, Mexico; [Velazquez-Perez, Actin H.] Colegio Postgrad, Fac Ciencias Forestales, Montecillos, Texcoco, Mexico",jvilladi@prodigy.net.mx,61,3,3,SISEF-SOC ITALIANA SELVICOLTURA ECOL FORESTALE,POTENZA,"DEPT PROD VEGETALE, VIA ATENEO LUCANO 10, POTENZA, 85100, ITALY",1971-7458,IFOREST,iForest,2020,gold,

Nuclear genetic markers (allozymes) revealed the rediscovered population to be closely related to those in other parts of the range. Targeted sampling in the south east of South Australia indicated a robust population, occupying vegetated ephemeral wetlands and drains across two fragmented and contrasting systems. Movement sampling failed to detect migrating juveniles, which was supported by otolith trace elemental chemistry, that implied a wholly freshwater or at least non-marine lifecycle.

The objective of this study is to identify suitable areas for ecological corridors (ECs) between two conservation units (CUs) located in the Espinhaco Range Biosphere Reserve (ERBR) in the Cerrado biome, Brazil, based on analytic hierarchy process (AHP), least-cost path (LCP) methods and landscape metrics. The methodology was based on the use of the AHP as a decision-making tool. Using the AHP, relative weights were attributed to the criteria used in the construction of land use, occupation, terrain slope and permanent preservation area (PPA) maps, which were then used for the delimitation of ECs in a GIS environment based on the LCP approach and landscape metrics. The results included a proposal of three ECs, listed as A, B and C, with areas of 34.28, 27.04 and 28.80 km2, respectively. The use of the AHP minimizes the subjectivity of the criteria used. The analyses identified that the ECs had similar habitat quality to that of the conservation units. EC-A presented the largest area of natural vegetation. EC-B presents comparable vegetation to that of EC-A and the shortest connection. EC-C contains the largest area of monoculture and is the least suitable option, given the choice of ECs.

The present work focuses on six lagoon fish species included in the Habitat Directive annex II (species requiring conservation measures:Aphanius fasciatus,A. iberus,Knipowitschia panizzae,Ninnigobius canestrinii,Valencia hispanicaandV. letourneuxi) that spend their entire life cycle in the Mediterranean priority habitat 1150* Coastal lagoons. The overview of the current scientific literature allowed us to highlight how the presence and abundance of these species may provide important indications on the conservation status of coastal lagoon habitats. In fact, their occurrence, distribution and biology depend on the presence of peculiar structures, such as salt marshes, small channels, isolated pools and oligohaline areas. Coastal lagoon fragmentation and habitat loss have led to a significant reduction in genetic diversity or local population extinction. AlthoughAphaniusand gobies have been shown to survive in eutrophic environments, it is clear that they cannot complete their life cycle without salt marshes (mainlyAphanius) and wetland areas (mainly gobies).","[Facca, Chiara; Cavraro, Francesco; Franzoi, Piero; Malavasi, Stefano] Ca Foscari Univ Venice, Dept Environm Sci Informat & Stat, Via Torino 155, I-30175 Venice, Italy",facca@unive.it; cavraro@unive.it; pfranzoi@unive.it; mala@unive.it,104,8,8,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,WATER-SUI,Water,2020,"Green Submitted, gold",

Understanding this diversity is key to addressing unequal power relations, avoiding the consideration of only dominant views, and identifying strategies to link science and practice. In turn, linking science and practice should promote conservation decisions that are socially robust and scientifically informed. To identify and describe the viewpoints of scientists and decision makers on how the science-practice interface should work in order to improve conservation decisions, we interviewed Brazilian scientists (ecologists and conservation scientists, n = 11) and decision makers (n = 11). We used Q methodology and asked participants to rank their agreement with 48 statements on how the science-practice interface should work in order to improve conservation decisions. We used principal component analysis to identify shared viewpoints. The predominant viewpoint, shared by scientists and decision makers, was characterized by valuing the integration of scientific and strategic knowledge to address environmental problems. The second viewpoint, held mostly by decision makers, was distinguished by assigning great importance to science in the decision-making process and calling for problem-relevant research. The third viewpoint, shared only by scientists, was characterized by an unwillingness to collaborate and a perception of scientists as producers of knowledge that may help decision makers. Most participants agreed organizations should promote collaboration and that actors and knowledge from both science and practice are relevant. Disagreements concerned specific roles assigned to actors, willingness to collaborate, and organizational and institutional arrangements considered effective to link science and practice. Our results suggest there is ample room for collaborations and that impediments lie mainly in existing organizations and formal institutional arrangements rather than in negative attitudes between scientists and decision makers.","[Bertuol-Garcia, Diana] Univ Sao Paulo, Inst Biociencias, Dept Ecol, Rua Matao,Travessa 14,101, BR-05508090 Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil; [Bertuol-Garcia, Diana; Morsello, Carla; El-Hani, Charbel N.; Pardini, Renata] Univ Fed Bahia, Natl Inst Sci & Technol Interdisciplinary & Trans, Rua Barao Geremoabo S-N,Campus Ondina UFBA, BR-40170290 Salvador, BA, Brazil; [Morsello, Carla] Univ Sao Paulo, Escola Artes Ciencias & Humanidades, Rua Arlindo Bettio 1000, BR-03828000 Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil; [El-Hani, Charbel N.] Univ Fed Bahia, Inst Biol, Rua Barao Geremoabo S-N,Campus Ondina UFBA, BR-40170290 Salvador, BA, Brazil; [Pardini, Renata] Univ Sao Paulo, Inst Biociencias, Dept Zool, Rua Matao,Travessa 14,101, BR-05508090 Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil",dia.bertuol@gmail.com,48,5,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0888-8892,CONSERV BIOL,Conserv.

Recently, ecological uniqueness has been proposed as an effective criterion because it allows the identification of species assemblages that are complementary and irreplaceable. This study aims to determine whether the ecological uniqueness of plant communities is an adequate criterion for assessing the conservation value of ecosystems. We used two large datasets of lake-edge wetlands located in southern Quebec (Canada) to achieve this objective. We computed the local contribution to beta diversity (LCBD) as a measure of uniqueness and evaluated its relationship to more common conservation criteria (richness, rarity and specialization of species, as well as site area and connectivity) using Pearson correlations and independent effects. Uniqueness decreased with increasing plant species richness, suggesting a conservation trade-off, whereas it increased with the percentage of rare and disturbance-sensitive specialist species. Highly unique sites were mostly of high conservation value, although the overall integrity of the landscape affected the quality of sites singled out as unique. The species composition of unique sites should be examined closely to determine their conservation value and other criteria should be used in conjunction with uniqueness to identify which set of sites to protect in a given landscape.","[Dubois, Raphaelle; Pellerin, Stephanie] Jardin Bot Montreal, Inst Rech Biol Vegetale, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Dubois, Raphaelle; Pellerin, Stephanie] Univ Montreal, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Dubois, Raphaelle; Proulx, Raphael; Pellerin, Stephanie] McGill Univ, Ctr Sci Biodiversite Quebec, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Dubois, Raphaelle; Proulx, Raphael; Pellerin, Stephanie] Univ Montreal, Grp Rech Interuniv Limnol, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Proulx, Raphael] Univ Quebec Montreal, Dept Sci Lenvironm, Trois Rivieres, PQ, Canada",raphaelle.dubois@umontreal.ca; raphael.proulx@uqtr.ca; stephanie.pellerin.1@umontreal.ca,64,6,6,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0006-3207,BIOL CONSERV,Biol.

Societal actors operating from multiple scales create and implement place-based solutions in SEPLS in response to landscape-specific challenges and opportunities for achieving biodiversity conservation and sustainable development. This study aims to identify and demonstrate the abundance of place-based solutions for solving challenges to sustainable use and management of natural resources in SEPLS, and to better inform the existing suite of conservation and restoration solutions. We review a set of 88 case studies from The International Partnership for the Satoyama Initiative (IPSI) in the South, East and Southeast Asian regions using a societal-based solution scanning approach to systematically identify these solutions for conservation and restoration at local scales and to categorize them by solution type. Societal actors demonstrate preferences for solution types to reversing the loss of BES in SEPLS while embracing a mix of all solution types across ecosystems. Institutional and governance solutions are the most common type across Asia. Technological solutions are preferred in East Asia, while knowledge and cognitive solutions are preferred in Southeast Asia. Economic and incentive-based solutions are found most often in South Asia as livelihood investments for local residents, and to balance trade-offs among food production and biodiversity conservation. Sharing the knowledge of various place-based solution types in different social-ecological contexts helps improve more purposeful and deliberate design of SEPLS for multiple benefits.","[Kozar, Raffaela; Galang, Elson; Sedhain, Jyoti; Alip, Alvie] United Nations Univ Inst Adv Study Sustainabil UN, Tokyo, Japan; [Subramanian, Suneetha M.] United Nations Univ Int Inst Global Hlth UNU IIGH, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; [Saito, Osamu] United Nations Univ Inst Adv Study Sustainabil UN, Shibuya Ku, Tokyo, Japan; [Saito, Osamu] Inst Global Environm Strategies IGES, Hayama, Kanagawa, Japan; [Saito, Osamu] Univ Tokyo, Inst Future Initiat IFI, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo, Japan",saito@unu.edu,79,1,1,SPRINGER-VERLAG SINGAPORE PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"152 BEACH ROAD, #21-01/04 GATEWAY EAST, SINGAPORE, 189721, SINGAPORE",2197-7348,SCI SUSTAIN SOC,,2020,"hybrid, Green Published",

Their spatial predictions are often used to prioritize areas for conservation. Individuals may, however, prefer settling in habitat types of low quality compared to other available habitats. This ecological trap phenomenon is usually studied in a small number of habitat patches and consequences at the landscape level are largely unknown. It is therefore often unclear whether the spatial pattern of habitat use is aligned with the behavioural decisions made by the individuals during habitat selection or reflects actual variation in the quality of different habitat types. As species distribution models analyse the pattern of occurrence in different habitats, there is a conservation interest in examining what their predictions mean in terms of habitat quality when ecological traps are operating. Previous work in Belgium showed that red-backed shrikes Lanius collurio are more attracted to newly available clear-cut habitat in plantation forests than to the traditionally used farmland habitat. We developed models with shrike distribution data and compared their predictions with spatial variation in shrike reproductive performance used as a proxy for habitat quality. Models accurately predicted shrike distribution and identified the preferred clear-cut patches as the most frequently used habitat, but reproductive performance was lower in clear-cut areas than in farmland. With human-induced rapid environmental changes, organisms may indeed be attracted to low-quality habitats and occupy them at high densities. Consequently, the predictions of statistical models based on occurrence records may not align with variation in significant population parameters for the maintenance of the species. When species expand their range to novel habitats, such models are useful to document the spatial distribution of the organisms, but data on population growth rates are worth collecting before using model predictions to guide the spatial prioritization of conservation actions.","[Titeux, Nicolas; Aizpurua, Olatz; Hermoso, Virgilio; Brotons, Lluis] Forest Sci Ctr Catalonia CTFC, InForest Joint Res Unit CTFC CREAF, Solsona, Spain; [Hermoso, Virgilio] Griffith Univ, Australian Rivers Inst, Nathan, Qld, Australia; [Brotons, Lluis] CREAF, Cerdanyola Del Valles, Spain; [Brotons, Lluis] CSIC, Cerdanyola Del Valles, Spain; [Titeux, Nicolas; Hollander, Franck A.; Van Dyck, Hans] UCL, Earth & Life Inst, Biodivers Res Ctr, Behav Ecol & Conservat Grp, Louvain La Neuve, Belgium; [Sarda-Palomera, Francesc] Forest Sci Ctr Catalonia CTFC, Biodivers & Anim Conservat Lab, Solsona, Spain; [Paquet, Jean-Yves] Aves Natagora, Dept Etud, Namur, Belgium; [Aizpurua, Olatz; Mestdagh, Xavier] LIST, Environm Res & Innovat ERIN, Esch Sur Alzette, Luxembourg; [Titeux, Nicolas; Settele, Josef] UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Community Ecol, Halle, Germany; [Titeux, Nicolas; Settele, Josef] German Ctr Integrat Biodivers Res iDiv, Leipzig, Germany",nicolas.titeux@idiv.de,76,7,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0906-7590,ECOGRAPHY,Ecography,2020,hybrid,

These areas are home to 55% of mammal species. Bats have the second highest species richness among mammals, and, although many species are adapted to arid conditions, they are particularly sensitive in these habitats and require conservation priority. Information on bats in arid and semi-arid landscapes is scattered, patchy and focused on small-scale studies; therefore, we undertook a systematic review using the PRISMA protocol to identify the current knowledge status, detect knowledge gaps and propose future research priorities. We analysed 346 published articles and evaluated 40 topics within five topic categories (taxa studied, methodologies used, biology, ecology and conservation). The most commonly studied topic categories were ecology and biology. However, we found a gap in the topic category conservation (including topics such as conservation status and roost conservation). Our network analysis of topics within the categories showed that most ecology papers were focused on distribution, species richness and habitat use. When we analysed keywords, we found that phylogeny, taxonomy and distribution demonstrated relatively high presence. Moreover, comparison of the percentage of studies conducted in dry-lands and the percentage of land surface area covered by dry-lands in the continents revealed that dry-lands in Africa and Australia were especially under-represented. Our review shows that knowledge of bats in semi-arid and arid landscapes is biased towards new records of the distribution of species, as well as covering systematic/taxonomic and morphological aspects of bat biology. We suggest that research on conservation measures and guidelines to protect the bat species found in semi-arid and arid landscapes should be prioritised, together with the sharing of knowledge with local practitioners and the development of citizen science programmes.","[Lison, Fulgencio; Altamirano, Adison] Univ La Frontera, Dept Ciencias Forestales, Lab Ecol Paisaje & Conservac, Box 45D, Temuco, Chile; [Lison, Fulgencio] Univ Concepcion, Fac Ciencias Nat & Oceanog, Dept Zool, Casilla 160-C, Concepcion, Chile; [Jimenez-Franco, Maria V.] Univ Miguel Hernandez, Dept Biol Aplicada, Area Ecol, Avda Univ S-N,Edf Vinalopo, Alicante 03202, Spain; [Jimenez-Franco, Maria V.] UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Ecol Modelling, D-04301 Leipzig, Germany; [Haz, Angeles] Paseo Rosales 10 4D, Murcia 30500, Spain; [Calvo, Jose F.] Univ Murcia, Dept Ecol & Hidrol, Campus Espinardo, E-30100 Murcia, Spain; [Jones, Gareth] Univ Bristol, Sch Biol Sci, 24 Tyndall Ave, Bristol BS8 1TQ, Avon, England",fulgencio.lison@ufrontera.cl; maria.jimenezf@umh.es; adison.altamirano@ufrontera.cl; angela.haz.c@gmail.com; jfcalvo@um.es; gareth.jones@bristol.ac.uk,101,9,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0305-1838,MAMMAL REV,Mammal Rev.,2020,,

It follows that species that are strongly linked to specific functions can represent these functions spatially and hence be useful in conservation planning. Here we test this notion of 'functional species surrogacy' for the conservation of seagrass meadows that have been impacted by stressors. We measured algal herbivory and herbivorous fish assemblages across a range of seagrass meadows in the Moreton Bay Marine Park, Queensland, Australia. We determined the suitability of herbivorous fish to act as a surrogate for the function of algal herbivory and modelled the abundance of this surrogate, and thus herbivory, in seagrass meadows to compare the spatial distribution of this function within existing reserves. We used underwater video systems to determine the abundance of all herbivorous fish species in seagrass meadows. The abundance of the dusky rabbitfish (Siganus fuscescens) was the best predictor of algal herbivory in seagrass meadows, supporting the suitability of this species as a functional surrogate. The distribution of dusky rabbitfish, and therefore the ecological function of herbivory, was not well represented in the Moreton Bay Marine Park protected areas. Only 7% of the equivalent area of seagrass meadows protected in marine reserves were found to have high abundances of dusky rabbitfish. We demonstrate that the abundance of functionally important herbivores can be suitable as a surrogate for herbivory in seagrass conservation. Our findings show that data on the spatial distribution of ecological functions can alter priorities for reserve design, and we suggest that our functional approach to species surrogacy is likely to improve conservation performance in seagrass ecosystems.","[Henderson, Christopher J.; Stevens, Tim; Lee, Shing Y.; Connolly, Rod M.; Warnken, Jan] Griffith Univ, Australian Rivers Inst Coasts & Estuaries, Gold Coast Campus G24,Parklands Dr, Southport, Qld 4222, Australia; [Henderson, Christopher J.; Stevens, Tim; Lee, Shing Y.; Connolly, Rod M.; Warnken, Jan] Griffith Univ, Griffith Sch Environm, Gold Coast Campus G24,Parklands Dr, Southport, Qld 4222, Australia; [Henderson, Christopher J.; Gilby, Ben L.; Schlacher, Thomas A.; Olds, Andrew D.] Univ Sunshine Coast, Sch Sci & Engn, Maroochydore, Qld 4558, Australia; [Henderson, Christopher J.; Lee, Shing Y.; Gilby, Ben L.; Olds, Andrew D.] Univ Sunshine Coast, Anim Ctr Hlth Ecol & Conservat Res, Maroochydore, Qld 4558, Australia; [Lee, Shing Y.] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Sch Life Sci, Simon FS Li Marine Sci Lab, Shatin, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Lee, Shing Y.] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Earth Syst Sci Programme, Shatin, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Maxwell, Paul S.] Hlth Land & Water, POB 13086,George St, Brisbane, Qld 4003, Australia",chender1@usc.edu.au,91,8,8,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1432-9840,ECOSYSTEMS,Ecosystems,2019,,

We assessed the relationship of dietary and habitat niche breadth on conservation status of skate species (Chondrichthyes, Rajiformes). We hypothesized that skate species with a narrow niche breadth have a higher conservation concern than skate species with wide niche breadth. Conservation status (IUCN), dietary and depth range data on 57 skate species were collected. Generalized linear mixed effect models were fitted with taxonomic level (genera nested within family) included as a random effect term in each model. In each model, body size of skate species was included as a variable because this life history trait is a known predictor of vulnerability. A model selection approach to test the level of support for alternative models was applied. Our results support the hypothesis that a narrow niche breadth is related to high vulnerability. Skate species with high probability of being of conservation concern have a narrow trophic niche breadth and a large body size. We conclude that dietary niche breadth together with body size may be an important trait to identify potentially vulnerable skate species. Conservation biology faces the challenge of identifying what species are vulnerable to anthropogenic stressors and to determine why this is so. The predictive value of our results may allow to know a priori which species should receive prioritary attention.","[Barbini, S. A.; Sabadin, D. E.; Figueroa, D.

The survey queried small-scale fishermen regarding perceptions and support for conservation. We constructed composite scores for three categories of perceptions-ecological effectiveness, social impacts, and good governance-and tested the relationship with levels of support using ordinal regression models. While all three factors were positively correlated with support for conservation, perceptions of good governance and social impacts were stronger predictors of increasing support.

Although a continuous marked trail has been established since 1937, protection of the corridor was not complete until the last couple of decades. Additional conservation designations exist adjacent to much of the trail corridor, but significant gaps in protection remain. A variety of land trusts and other non-profit conservation organizations, federal and state land management agencies, and regional trail clubs overseen by the Appalachian Trail Conservancy (ATC) actively seek to add to the local, regional, and national conservation significance of this landscape or to improve the management of lands already protected. Here, we assess biodiversity and ecological integrity along the entire AT among 2,123 trail sampling segments and four planning regions. We evaluated gradients of biodiversity and ecological integrity in relation to the existing management status of trail sampling segments to identify gaps in protection of high value areas. The AT possesses high species diversity at the southern end, where much of it exists in federal multiple-use management, and high ecological integrity in the north on private timberlands. Inadequately protected areas of such high biological diversity and ecological integrity occur throughout the trail.

The field of movement ecology has established a conceptual framework to analyze the lifetime movement of an organism, offering a sound basis for conservation actions since the movement range of many species has been altered by habitat fragmentation and degradation. An organism's lifetime movement is organized around three main functions-exploitation, exploration, and relocation-which are associated with specific behavioral mechanisms and spatio-temporal scales. The movement ecology framework is a valuable tool as applied to amphibians, as managing these spatially structured populations requires in-depth knowledge of the behavioral mechanisms that determine movement. In terms of exploitation, these animals have a complex lifecycle, which involves migrating between different types of habitat, thus requiring them to cross a landscape matrix that may be more or less inhospitable. In terms of exploration and relocation, between-pond movements within the pond archipelagoes of a given population are frequent and strongly contribute to population resilience. Relocation also occurs at a larger scale, through long-distance dispersal to colonize new patches, exposing the individuals to unknown environments. Each function, at each scale, involves specific interactions between individual motivation (phenotype dependence) and environmental quality (context dependence) that determine decision-making and fitness outputs. Long-term exposure to local selective pressures can lead to differentiation in coping types that could be considered as Evolutionarily Significant Units (ESUs) for conservation. At the scale of a patch, the optimal direction of migration can be inherited, thus allowing the optimization of migration routes for juveniles. At the regional scale, a dispersal syndrome resulting in a greater propensity for boldness and exploration could be a response to unpredictable breeding sites or the high benefits of colonizing a rich habitat. Greater knowledge about such behavioral adaptations to specific situations would allow more targeted development of conservation measures or help to stop the spread of invasive species. The evolutionary context of movement behavior is thus of primary interest in designing effective conservation actions in a changing world.","[Joly, Pierre] Univ Lyon, ENTPE, CNRS, UMR LEHNA, Villeurbanne, France",pierre.joly@univ-lyon1.fr,246,18,18,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",2296-701X,FRONT ECOL EVOL,Front.

In the early years of conservation science, ecologists extended principles of island biogeography to assess connectivity based on source patch proximity and other metrics derived from binary maps of habitat. From 2006 to 2008, the late Brad McRae introduced circuit theory as an alternative approach to model gene flow and the dispersal or movement routes of organisms. He posited concepts and metrics from electrical circuit theory as a robust way to quantify movement across multiple possible paths in a landscape, not just a single least-cost path or corridor. Circuit theory offers many theoretical, conceptual, and practical linkages to conservation science. We reviewed 459 recent studies citing circuit theory or the open-source software Circuitscape. We focused on applications of circuit theory to the science and practice of connectivity conservation, including topics in landscape and population genetics, movement and dispersal paths of organisms, anthropogenic barriers to connectivity, fire behavior, water flow, and ecosystem services. Circuit theory is likely to have an effect on conservation science and practitioners through improved insights into landscape dynamics, animal movement, and habitat-use studies and through the development of new software tools for data analysis and visualization. The influence of circuit theory on conservation comes from the theoretical basis and elegance of the approach and the powerful collaborations and active user community that have emerged. Circuit theory provides a springboard for ecological understanding and will remain an important conservation tool for researchers and practitioners around the globe.","[Dickson, Brett G.; Albano, Christine M.; Gray, Miranda E.; McClure, Meredith L.; Theobald, David M.] Conservat Sci Partners Inc, 11050 Pioneer Trail,Suite 202, Truckee, CA 96161 USA; [Dickson, Brett G.] No Arizona Univ, Landscape Conservat Initiat, Box 5694, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA; [Anantharaman, Ranjan; Shah, Viral B.] Julia Comp, 45 Prospect St, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Beier, Paul] No Arizona Univ, Sch Forestry, Box 15018, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA; [Fargione, Joe; Hall, Kimberly R.] Nat Conservancy North Amer Reg, 1101 West River Pkwy,Suite 200, Minneapolis, MN 55415 USA; [Graves, Tabitha A.] US Geol Survey, Northern Rocky Mt Sci Ctr, 38 Mather Dr, West Glacier, MT 59936 USA; [Lawler, Josh J.; Littlefield, Caitlin E.] Univ Washington, Sch Environm & Forest Sci, Box 352100, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Leonard, Paul B.] US Fish & Wildlife Serv, Sci Applicat, 101 12th Ave,110, Fairbanks, AK 99701 USA; [Novembre, John] Univ Chicago, Dept Human Genet, Dept Ecol & Evolut, 920 East 58th St, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Schloss, Carrie A.] Nature Conservancy, 201 Mission St, San Francisco, CA 94105 USA; [Schumaker, Nathan H.] US EPA, 200 Southwest 35th St, Corvallis, OR 97330 USA",brett@csp-inc.org,112,84,89,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0888-8892,CONSERV BIOL,Conserv.

Abalone are presently scarce compared to the mid-1900s, but more abundant than before the early 1800s, calling their endangered status into question. Linking multiple knowledge sources can build SES understanding, facilitate power sharing, and support ecologically sustainable and socially just conservation outcomes.","[Lee, Lynn Chi; Salomon, Anne Katherine] Simon Fraser Univ, Sch Resource & Environm Management, 8888 Univ Dr, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada; [Thorley, Joe] Poisson Consulting Ltd, Nelson, BC, Canada; [Watson, Jane] Vancouver Isl Univ, Biol Dept, Nanaimo, BC, Canada; [Reid, Mike] Heiltsuk Integrated Resource Management Dept, Bella Bella, BC, Canada",lynn_chi_lee@sfu.ca,45,9,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1755-263X,CONSERV LETT,Conserv.

However, the relationship between ecosystem services and biodiversity is contested and needs clarification. The goal of this chapter is to spell out the interaction and reciprocal influences between conservation science, evolutionary biology, and ecology, in order to understand whether a stronger integration of evolutionary and ecological studies might help clarify the interaction between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning as well as influence biodiversity conservation practices. To this end, the eco-evolutionary feedback theory proposed by David Post and Eric Palkovacs is analysed, arguing that it helps operationalise niche construction theory and develop a more sophisticated understanding of the relationship between ecosystem functioning and biodiversity. Finally, it is proposed that by deepening the integration of ecological and evolutionary factors in our understanding of ecosystem functioning, the eco-evolutionary feedback theory is supportive of an evolutionary-enlightened management of biodiversity within the ecosystem services approach.","[Di Marco, Silvia] Univ Lisbon, Ctr Filosofia Ciencias, Lisbon, Portugal",sdmarco@fc.ul.pt,61,0,0,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",2211-1948,HIST PHIL THEOR LIFE,,2019,"hybrid, Green Published",

The problem is particularly manifested when calculating metrics for extinction risk estimation, for example, area of occupancy (AOO). Although embedded in the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List criteria, AOO is often not used or is poorly applied. We evaluated new and existing methods for calculating AOO from occurrence records and devised a method for determining the minimum AOO with a uniform grid. We evaluated the grid cell shape, origin, and rotation with real-world and simulated data and reviewed the effects on AOO values and possible impacts for species already assessed on the IUCN Red List. The AOO varied by up to 80%, and a ratio of cells to points of 1:1.21 yielded the maximum variation in the number of occupied cells. These findings potentially impact 3% of existing species on the IUCN Red List and species not yet assessed. Our new method combined grid rotation and moving grid origin and gave fast, robust, and reproducible results and, in the majority of cases, achieved the minimum AOO. As well as determining minimum AOO, our method yielded a confidence interval that should be incorporated into existing tools that support species risk assessment. We recommend when recording AOO and other areal measurements that the methods; summary statistics across multiple iterations; angle and origin of the minimum grid; map projection; and datum be recorded, this will lead to more robust species risk assessments.","[Moat, Justin; Bachman, Steven P.] Kew, Royal Bot Gardens, Richmond TW9 3AE, Surrey, England; [Moat, Justin; Bachman, Steven P.; Field, Richard; Boyd, Doreen S.] Univ Nottingham, Sch Geog, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England",j.moat@kew.org,32,9,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0888-8892,CONSERV BIOL,Conserv.

In this paper, we address both issues through a case study with Tsimane' Amerindians in the Bolivian Amazon. We sampled 624 households across 59 villages to estimate TEK and used remote sensing data to assess forest conservation. We ran statistical and spatial analyses to evaluate whether TEK was associated and spatially overlapped with forest conservation at the village level. We find that Tsimane' TEK is significantly and positively associated with forest conservation although acculturation variables bear stronger and negative associations with forest conservation. We also find a very significant spatial overlap between levels of Tsimane' TEK and forest conservation. We discuss the potential reasons underpinning our results, which provide insights that may be useful for informing policies in the realms of development, conservation, and climate.

In the case of the world's many island communities whose colonial histories extend into the present in virtually every domain, silences around sovereignty in conservation contexts are particularly notable for the way they suggest the enduring domination of local communities by distant metropoles. Here, we provide a review of several critical issues in Pacific Islands contexts - biosecurity, food security, intellectual and material property rights and protected areas - that highlight the importance of conceptualizing sovereignty beyond the state to better enhance conservation outcomes. The novel approach we take in regard to these problems is to encourage conservation practitioners to more deeply engage with the 'ecological futures' that indigenous and local island communities are weaving in a period of active (re)articulations of sovereignty in conception, legal constitution and everyday engagements with island environments.","[Mawyer, Alexander] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Ctr Pacific Isl Studies, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Jacka, Jerry K.] Univ Colorado, Dept Anthropol, Boulder, CO 80309 USA",mawyer@hawaii.edu,170,14,14,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0376-8929,ENVIRON CONSERV,Environ.

In the U.S., state parks are afforded direct protection from localized development pressures, which may help to protect small, ecologically significant ecosystems such as isolated and ephemeral wetlands and headwater streams. We used the South Carolina State Park system as a case study to examine the structural and functional differences between small wetlands located inside vs. outside of parks in the Piedmont and Blue Ridge ecoregions in order to evaluate the efficacy of a small-scale conservation framework for protecting small, under-protected freshwater ecosystems. We evaluated data relating to water quality, wetland structure, and biodiversity parameters collected between January 2010 and June 2011. Our results indicated marked differences between park and non-park wetlands, with park wetlands having shallower depths, higher abundances of sensitive benthic macroinvertebrate taxa, and lower average tolerance values consistent with more sensitive macroinvertebrate species and higher water quality. These findings demonstrate that state parks can serve to protect freshwater ecosystems and biodiversity. State parks, thus, represent a preexisting network of protected areas to aid in the protection of localized habitats, such as small isolated and ephemeral wetlands, that may not otherwise receive the conservation protection warranted by their ecological function.","[Pitt, Amber L.] Trinity Coll, Environm Sci Program, 300 Summit St, Hartford, CT 06106 USA; [Pitt, Amber L.] Trinity Coll, Dept Biol, 300 Summit St, Hartford, CT 06106 USA; [Howard, Joanna Hawley; Baldwin, Robert F.] Clemson Univ, Dept Forestry & Environm Conservat, 261 Lehotsky Hall, Clemson, SC 29634 USA; [Baldwin, Elizabeth D.] Clemson Univ, Dept Pk Recreat & Tourism Management, 263 Lehotsky Hall, Clemson, SC 29634 USA; [Brown, Bryan L.] Virginia Tech, Dept Biol Sci, 1405 Perry St, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA",amber.pitt@trincoll.edu,105,2,3,NATURAL AREAS ASSOC,ROCKFORD,"320 SOUTH THIRD ST, ROCKFORD, IL 61104 USA",0885-8608,NAT AREA J,Nat.

However, conservation planning associated with the large-scale network in China involves important information loopholes about the land cover and landscape connectivity. In this paper, we made an integrative analysis for the identification of conservation priority areas and least-cost ecological corridors (ECs) in order to promote a more representative, connected and efficient ecological PA network for this country. First, we used Zonation, a spatial prioritization software, to achieve a hierarchical mask and selected the top priority conservation areas. Second, we identified optimal linkages between two patches as corridors based on least-cost path algorithm. Finally, we proposed a new framework of China's PA network composed of conservation priority and ECs in consideration of high connectivity between areas. We observed that priority areas identified here cover 12.9% of the region, distributed mainly in mountainous and plateau areas, and only reflect a spatialmismatch of 19% with the current China's nature reserves locations. Fromthe perspective of conservation, our result provide the need to consider new PA categories, specially located in the south (e.g., the middle-lower Yangtze River area, Nanling and Min-Zhe-Gan Mountains) and north regions (e.g., Changbai Mountains), in order to construct an optimal and connected national network in China. This information allows us better opportunities to identify the relative high-quality patches and draft the best conservation plan for the China's biodiversity in the long-term run.

Tanzania and the so-called Tarangire-Manyara Ecosystem illustrate how these biopolitical shifts became entangled with conservation interventions and broader visions of development throughout colonial and post-colonial history. Colonial efforts to balance seemingly competing domains of human and nonhuman species through spatial separation gave way to the development of the post-colonial nation through the nurturing of its wildlife population. This shift from human-nonhuman incompatibility towards human dependency on wildlife and biodiversity conservation culminated in the contemporary biopolitical ecology and geography of landscape conservation. Landscape conservation seeks to entangle human and nonhuman species. Through conservation, human populations are rearranged and fixed in time and space to allow wildlife to roam free across unbounded spaces. This conservation governmentality is tied to global environmentalist concerns and political economies of neoliberal conservation, as well as to a domestic agenda of tourism-based economic growth. It secures land tenure for some, while imposing a biopolitical sacrifice on the rural population as a whole. This forecloses alternative rural futures for a land-dependent and increasingly land-deprived population.","[Bluwstein, Jevgeniy] Univ Copenhagen, Global Dev Sect, Copenhagen, Denmark",jevgeniy@ifro.ku.dk,112,19,20,UNIV ARIZONA LIBRARIES,TUCSON,"UNIV ARIZONA LIBRARIES, TUCSON, AZ 85721 USA",1073-0451,J POLIT ECOL,J.

As of the late 20th century, more than 63 000 km of canals exist worldwide as transport routes for navigation, many with barriers (e.g., locks, dams) that fragment the system and decrease connectivity. Fragmentation alone can have negative implications for freshwater biodiversity; by isolating populations and communities, other human-mediated disturbances associated with canals like poor water quality and invasive species can exacerbate these negative effects. As such, the capacity of these interconnected freshwater systems to support biodiversity is continuously degrading at a global level. One critical, highly complex issue that unites canals worldwide is the challenge of governing these systems in a holistic, unified way to both protect biodiversity and preserve historical elements. Managing historic canals involves multiple objectives across many agencies and stakeholders, often with different or conflicting objectives. Here, we use the Rideau Canal, a UNESCO World Heritage Site and National Historic Site of Canada, as a case study to demonstrate the importance of considering canals as social-ecological systems for effective and efficient governance. Historic canals are integrated systems of both humans (social) and the environment (ecological), linked by mutual feedbacks and coevolution, and must be managed as such to achieve conservation goals while maintaining commemorative integrity. We discuss the history of the Rideau Canal and its current governance, biodiversity in the waterway, different threats and issues (user conflicts, aquatic pollution, shoreline development, water management, species at risk, and invasive species), and conclude by outlining ways to address the challenges of managing it as a coupled social-ecological system. We present different research needs and opportunities that would enable better management, though above all, we propose a shift from the current governance structure - which at best can be considered patchwork - to a coordinated, multi-scalar and multi-stakeholder governance regime such that the Rideau Canal can be maintained for its historical integrity without compromising biodiversity conservation. Given that canals are now pervasive worldwide, this article is not only topical to the Rideau Canal, but also to other waterways in Canada and beyond.","[Bergman, Jordanna N.; Lin, Hsien-Yung; Bennett, Joseph R.; Trottier, Lindsay L.; Abrams, Alice E., I; Beaupre, Patrick; Glassman, Danny; Donaldson, Lisa; Vermaire, Jesse C.; Cooke, Steven J.] Carleton Univ, 1125 Colonel By Dr, Ottawa, ON K1S 5B6, Canada; [Beaudoin, Christine; Mistry, Isha; Turcotte, Audrey; Neigel, Kate; Young, Nathan; Rennie, Colin; Blouin-Demers, Gabriel] Univ Ottawa, 75 Laurier Ave E, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada; [Vis, Chantal] Protected Areas Estab & Conservat Directorate, Pk Canada, Gatineau, PQ J8X 0B3, Canada; [Minelga, Valerie] Ontario Waterways, Pk Canada, Peterborough, ON K9J 6Z6, Canada; [Garant, Dany] Univ Sherbrooke, 2500 Blvd Univ, Sherbrooke, PQ J1K 2R1, Canada; [Smol, John P.] Queens Univ, 99 Univ Ave, Kingston, ON K7L 3N6, Canada",jordannanbergman@gmail.com,145,1,1,CANADIAN SCIENCE PUBLISHING,OTTAWA,"65 AURIGA DR, SUITE 203, OTTAWA, ON K2E 7W6, CANADA",1208-6053,ENVIRON REV,Environ.

Despite multiple case studies testing the sparing-sharing trade-off, this framework still lacks the ability to identify the conditions in which sparing, or sharing, would be the preferred strategy for pareto-optimizing both food production and biodiversity. Under some conditions, ecosystem services may create a positive feedback between biodiversity and crop production, affecting the optimization. This study aims to identify the conditions and the relevant variables that determine the preferred land use strategy in terms of maximizing both biodiversity and food production, while accounting for positive feedback of ecosystem services in this analysis. We used a simulation model with data from a mixed cropping landscape (100 km(2)) covering seven crop types, five taxonomic groups, three biodiversity metrics and 23 bioindicators to explore the variables shaping the biodiversity-production trade-off and ecosystem services underlying it. We explored a continuum of sparing large semi-natural patches to sharing by maintaining uncultivated field margins of varying size. Land sparing outperformed land sharing in 62% of the scenarios and it was economically more predictable. The optimization was shaped by costs, associated with crop type, rather than by landscape composition and configuration, biodiversity metric, taxonomic group or bioindicator. Landscape configuration and taxonomic group results corroborate the notion that land sharing benefits mainly small organisms, and that the common width of field margins in many agri-environmental policies (10 m) is not cost-effective compared to land sparing. Land sharing was the optimal strategy whenever it resulted in minimal costs, despite contributing little to biodiversity. Yet, when field margins were >20 m wide (small-scale sparing), land sharing maintained higher biodiversity and was at least as cost-effective as sparing. Synthesis and applications. Our model highlights the importance of socio-economic variables compared to ecological variables in selecting land-management strategy to pareto-optimize both food production and biodiversity. Considering opportunity costs alongside economic benefits from ecosystem services in various cropping systems may therefore improve the cost-effectiveness of biodiversity conservation policies in agricultural landscapes.","[Segre, Hila; Shwartz, Assaf] Technion Israel Inst Technol, Fac Architecture & Town Planning, Haifa, Israel; [Segre, Hila] Wageningen Univ, Plant Ecol & Nat Conservat Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Carmel, Yohay] Technion Israel Inst Technol, Fac Civil & Environm Engn, Haifa, Israel",hilasegre@gmail.com,50,0,0,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8901,J APPL ECOL,J.

International and national policies advocating for the development of the Amazon often conflict with the environmental sector tasked with conserving its unique ecosystems and peoples through a sustainable development agenda. New practices of environmental governance can help mitigate adverse socio-economic and ecological effects. For example, forming a community of practice and learning (CoP-L) is an approach for improving governance via collaboration and knowledge exchange. The Governance and Infrastructure in the Amazon (GIA) project, in which this study is embedded, has proposed that fostering a CoP-L on tools and strategies to improve infrastructure governance can serve as a mechanism to promote learning and action on factors related to governance effectiveness. A particular tool used by the GIA project for generating and sharing knowledge has been participatory mapping (Pmap). This study analyzes Pmap exercises conducted through workshops in four different Amazonian regions. The goal of Pmap was to capture different perspectives from stakeholders based on their experiences and interests to visualize and reflect on (1) areas of value, (2) areas of concern and (3) recommended actions related to reducing impacts of infrastructure development and improvement of governance processes. We used a mixed-methods approach to explore textual analysis, regional multi-iteration discussion with stakeholders, participatory mapping and integration with ancillary geospatial datasets. We believe that by sharing local-knowledge-driven data and strengthening multi-actor dialogue and collaboration, this novel approach can improve day to day practices of CoP-L members and, therefore, the transparency of infrastructure planning and good governance.","[Mere-Roncal, Carla; Veluk Gutierrez, Felipe; Broadbent, Eben North] Univ Florida, Sch Forest Fisheries & Geomat Sci, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Mere-Roncal, Carla; Chavez, Andrea Birgit; Almeyda Zambrano, Angelica Maria; Schmitz Bongiolo, Eduardo; Broadbent, Eben North] Univ Florida, Spatial Ecol & Conservat Lab, Sch Forest Fisheries & Geomat Sci, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Cardoso Carrero, Gabriel] Univ Florida, Dept Geog, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Chavez, Andrea Birgit; Almeyda Zambrano, Angelica Maria; Loiselle, Bette] Univ Florida, Ctr Latin Amer Studies, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Loiselle, Bette] Univ Florida, Dept Wildlife Ecol & Conservat, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Luna-Celino, Vanessa; Arteaga, Marliz] Univ Florida, Sch Nat Resources & Environm, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Segura Tomasi, Andre] Inst Int Educ Brasil IEB, BR-70863520 Brasilia, Brazil; [Van Damme, Paul Andre] Inst Invest Aplicada Recursos Acuat, Faunagua, Sacaba Cochabamba 31001, Bolivia; [Lizarro Zapata, Dennis Edgar] Univ Autonoma Beni Mcal Jose Ballivian, Ctr Invest Recursos Acuat, Campus Univ Hernan Melgar Justiniano, Trinidad, Bolivia",cmereroncal@ufl.edu; gcarrero@ufl.edu; achavez@ufl.edu; aalmeyda@ufl.edu; bloiselle@latam.ufl.edu; felipe.gutierrez@ufl.edu; lunacelino.dv@ufl.edu; marliz@ufl.edu; eduardosbongiolo@gmail.com; andre@iieb.org.br; paulandrevandamme@gmail.com; delizarroz@uabjb.edu.bo; eben@ufl.edu,78,0,0,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,2021,gold,

Conservation policies could be improved by relying on robust knowledge about the relative ecological impacts of water-based recreation. We present the first global synthesis on recreation ecology in aquatic ecosystems, differentiating the ecological impacts of shore use, (shoreline) angling, swimming and boating. Impacts were assessed at three levels of biological organization (individuals, populations and communities) for several taxa. We screened over 13 000 articles and identified 94 suitable studies that met the inclusion criteria, providing 701 effect sizes. Impacts of boating and shore use resulted in consistently negative, significant ecological impacts across all levels of biological organization. The results were less consistent for angling and swimming. The strongest negative effects were observed in invertebrates and plants. Recreational impacts on birds were most pronounced at the individual level, but not significant at the community level. Due to publication bias and knowledge gaps, generalizations of the ecological impacts of aquatic recreation are challenging. Impacts depend less on the form of recreation. Thus, selectively constraining specific types of recreation may have little conservation value, as long as other forms of water-based recreation continue.","[Schafft, Malwina; Wegner, Benjamin; Wolter, Christian; Arlinghaus, Robert] Leibniz Inst Freshwater Ecol & Inland Fisheries, Dept Biol & Ecol Fishes, Muggelseedamm 310, D-12587 Berlin, Germany; [Schafft, Malwina; Wegner, Benjamin; Arlinghaus, Robert] Humboldt Univ, Fac Life Sci, Dept Crop & Anim Sci, Div Integrat Fisheries Management, Philippstr 13,Haus 7, D-10115 Berlin, Germany; [Meyer, Nora] Tech Univ Dresden, Inst Gen Ecol & Environm Protect, Pienner Str 7, D-01737 Tharandt, Germany",schafft@igb-berlin.de,68,2,2,ROYAL SOC,LONDON,"6-9 CARLTON HOUSE TERRACE, LONDON SW1Y 5AG, ENGLAND",0962-8452,P ROY SOC B-BIOL SCI,Proc.

Changes were assessed at different spatial and temporal scales using a macrobenthic dataset based on 38 stations sampled in 1987 and 2019, coupled with data from one station sampled annually between 2005 and 2019 as part of the European Water Framework Directive monitoring programme. Taxonomic trajectories indicated 1) changes in the structure and distribution of benthic assemblages, 2) an homogenization of the assemblages, and 3) significant functional shifts. Fishing activities and nutrient enrichment are probably strong drivers of the observed changes, as suggested by the higher mortality rate of fragile, flexible, tubiculous and burrowing species, and the increase in the abundance of opportunistic species in the assemblages. Certain populations of macroinvertebrates seem jointly controlled by climate change and by the aforementioned local factors of disturbance. The Community Trajectory Analysis framework appears as a new and interesting method to track ecological changes in marine ecosystems by measuring change with respect to a baseline state, to help define ecological recovery (station returning to the initial ecological state) and departure (station presenting increased changes over time), and to analyse trajectory similarity. According to the degradation of habitat over time, we identify the need for the implementation of knowledge-based conservation strategies, especially within Natura 2000 sites.","[Sturbois, Anthony] Vivarmor Nat, 18 C Rue Sabot, F-22440 Ploufragan, France; [Sturbois, Anthony; Cormy, Gaetan; Le Moal, Alexandre; Ponsero, Alain] Reserve Nat Natl Baie St Brieuc, Hillion, France; [Sturbois, Anthony; Schaal, Gauthier; Gauthier, Olivier] UBO, CNRS, UMR 6539, Lab Sci Environ Marin LEMAR,IRD,IFREMER, Plouzane, France; [Ponsero, Alain] St Brieuc Agglomerat Baie Armor, St Brieuc, France; [Sturbois, Anthony; Le Mao, Patrick; Desroy, Nicolas] IFREMER, Lab Environm & Ressources Bretagne Nord, Dinard, France; [Schaal, Gauthier; Broudin, Caroline; Riera, Pascal] Sorbonne Univ, Stn Biolog Roscoff, CNRS, UMR7144, Roscoff, France; [Jones, Auriane] Univ Montpellier, CNRS, MARBEC, IFREMER,IRD, Sete, France",anthony.sturbois@espaces-naturels.fr,100,1,1,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1052-7613,AQUAT CONSERV,Aquat.

We conducted a quantitative systematic literature review and meta-analysis on how researchers and decision-makers include ecological processes in coastal and marine conservation planning. Marine spatial planning ideally delivers representative protected areas systems that deliver persistence for ecosystems and species. Although several reviews have reported on incorporating connectivity as a process in marine spatial planning, to our knowledge, no one has yet published an inclusive review on how ecological processes are incorporated to help ensure persistence in coastal and marine planning. A total of 162 peer-reviewed journal research papers and 27 non-peer-reviewed papers (n = 189) were identified that included ecological processes in coastal and marine conservation planning between 2000 and 2019, the number of papers integrating ecological processes peaked in 2013 followed by a declining trend to 2019. We attribute the trend to the complexity of the problem of integrating dispersal and demographic objectives alongside other management goals. The results of our statistical analysis uncovered that incorporating ecological processes in conservation planning is important for coastal and marine ecosystems across the literature (p-value < 0.001). However, there was significant variation in scope and choice of method in planning assessments. Dispersal was the process most frequently incorporated in spatial plans, followed by demography and flows of nonliving materials. Identifying appropriate ecosystem objectives and incorporating multiple sources of uncertainty into conservation planning for coastal and marine ecosystems remain important areas for future research. This review highlights the need for greater awareness among planners of the relevance of ecological processes in conservation planning for coastal and marine ecosystems.","[Chamberlain, Debbie A.; Possingham, Hugh P.] Univ Queensland, Ctr Biodivers & Conservat Sci, Sch Biol Sci, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia; [Chamberlain, Debbie A.; Phinn, Stuart R.] Univ Queensland, Remote Sensing Res Ctr, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia; [Possingham, Hugh P.] Queensland Govt, Brisbane, Qld 4000, Australia",d.chamberlain@uq.edu.au; h.possingham@uq.edu.au; s.phinn@uq.edu.au,114,0,0,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1386-2588,AQUAT ECOL,Aquat.

These declines are exacerbated by the generally limited dispersal ability of insects, which make local populations susceptible to extirpation following habitat fragmentation. Interest in pollinator conservation has grown substantially in recent years, but information to guide pollinator conservation across the region is limited. We used pollinator biology along with principles of landscape ecology and metapopulation dynamics to develop a simple decision matrix based on patch size and inter-patch distances to guide landscape-scale grassland conservation efforts in the U.S. northern Great Plains. When applied to spatial land cover data depicting potential pollinator habitat, the matrix uses landscape characteristics to guide placement of conservation treatments to help ensure persistence of target pollinator populations. Patch size and connectivity thresholds can be set to match characteristics of target species, but in all cases, local management will be necessary to ensure that fine-grained features such as nectar sources and host plants are present. Applying the matrix to habitat layers for a nine-state analysis region showed substantial geographic variation in conservation needs, opportunities, and potential treatments. We also demonstrate that non-native planted cover such as alfalfa and certain grasslands enrolled in the Conservation Reserve Program can substantially enhance landscape structure by increasing grassland patch size and core area while decreasing distance between patches. Pollinators dependent on native prairie will also benefit from planted cover that provides nectar sources and serves as a buffer from pesticides associated with croplands. Consistent with the principles of strategic habitat conservation, targeted monitoring and research will be necessary to validate and adapt the model to meet local conditions.","[Niemuth, Neal D.; Wangler, Brian; Pritchert, Ronald D.] US Fish & Wildlife Serv, Habitat & Populat Evaluat Team, Bismarck, ND 58501 USA; [LeBrun, Jaymi J.] US Fish & Wildlife Serv, Habitat & Populat Evaluat Team, Bloomington, MN 55437 USA; [Dewald, David; Schwagler, Todd; Bradbury, Curtis W.] US Dept Agr, Nat Resources Conservat Serv, Bismarck, ND 58501 USA; [Larson, Scott] US Fish & Wildlife Serv, Ecol Serv, Pierre, SD 57501 USA; [Iovanna, Rich] US Dept Agr, Farm Prod & Conservat, Washington, DC 20250 USA",Neal_Niemuth@fws.gov,129,0,0,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2150-8925,ECOSPHERE,Ecosphere,2021,,

Conflicts between snakes and people occur when residents encounter snakes in their home environments. In collaboration with a local business that provides snake removal services, we examined records from over 2000 snake removals in Phoenix metropolitan area, Arizona, United States between 2018 and 2019. We examined removal locations in relation to neighborhood-level socioeconomic attributes from the American Community Survey and individual demographics from a social survey of 494 respondents. Over 68% of removals were of the venomous Western Diamond-backed Rattlesnake (Crotalus atrox), which is the most common species in the area observed in community-sourced data and publications. Removals occurred throughout the year except winter and peaked during summer rainy season. Snakes were frequently removed from neighborhoods with wealthier and more highly educated residents, greater proportion of Latinx residents, and recently constructed homes. Individual perceptions of snakes as problematic were not related to the number of snakes removed. This research is the first to analyze snake removals in a social-ecological context and underscores the conservation benefits of researchers partnering with a local business to gain spatial and temporal information on an elusive taxon. Similar collaborations could lead to direct conservation action for snakes by researchers learning from community members in cities and by groups willing to use results from research partnerships to inform their practices. Understanding how to maintain biodiversity in urbanizing arid regions could protect snakes if relocating snakes away from areas of high human density translates into fewer snakes killed by people annually.

This represents an enormous potential loss of biodiversity and cost to human societies due to the economic benefits that birds provide through ecosystem services and ecotourism. Conservation of migratory bird species presents many unique challenges, as these birds rely on multiple geographically distinct habitats, including breeding grounds, non-breeding grounds, and stopover sites during migration. In particular, stopover habitats are seldom studied relative to breeding and non-breeding habitats, despite their importance as refueling stations for migratory birds. In this study, we summarize the current research on the use of temporary primary crops by birds during migration and we assess the species characteristics and agricultural practices most often associated with the use of cropland as stopover habitat. First, we conducted a systematic review of the literature to document the effects various farming practices and crop types have on the abundance and diversity of migratory birds using agricultural areas for stopovers. Second, we analyzed the ecological correlates of bird species in the Northern Hemisphere that predict which species may use these areas while migrating. We ran a GLMM to test whether primary diet, diet breadth, primary habitat, habitat breadth, or realm predicted stopover use of agricultural areas. Our review suggests that particular crop types (principally rice, corn, and sunflower), as well as farming practices that result in higher non-cultivated plant diversity, encourage the use of agricultural areas by migrating birds. We found that cropland is used as stopover habitat by bird species that can utilize a large breadth of habitats, as well as species with preferences for habitat similar in structure to agricultural areas.","[Blount, J.

It has three primary objectives: national designation and management of wetlands of international importance; general wise use of wetlands; and international cooperation. We examined lessons learnt for improving wetland conservation after Ramsar's nearly five decades of operation. The number of wetlands in the Ramsar Site Network has grown over time (2,391 Ramsar Sites, 2.5 million km(2), as at 2020-06-09) but unevenly around the world, with decreasing rate of growth in recent decades. Ramsar Sites are concentrated in countries with a high Gross Domestic Product and human pressure (e.g., western Europe) but, in contrast, Ramsar Sites with the largest wetland extent are in central-west Africa and South America. We identified three key challenges for improving effectiveness of the Ramsar Site Network: increasing number of sites and wetland area, improved representation (functional, geographical and biological); and effective management and reporting. Increasing the number of sites and area in the Ramsar network could benefit from targets, implemented at national scales. Knowledge of representativeness is inadequate, requiring analyses of functional ecotypes, geographical and biological representativeness. Finally, most countries have inadequate management planning and reporting on the ecological character of their Ramsar Sites, requiring more focused attention on a vision and objectives, with regular reporting of key indicators to guide management. There are increasing opportunities to rigorously track ecological character, utilizing new tools and available indicators (e.g., remote sensing). It is critical that the world protect its wetlands, with an effective Ramsar Convention or the Convention on Wetlands at the core.","[Kingsford, R. T.; Bino, G.; Finlayson, C. M.; Thomas, R.

We used ecological niche models projected as species potential distributions of endemic terrestrial vertebrates and quantified spatiotemporal cumulative habitat loss trajectories projected in species extant distributions, using land use and land cover vegetation maps (LULC) time series (1985, 1993, 2002, 2007, 2011, and 2014). Of a total of 996 species, only 311 species produced robust species potential distribution models. Significant differences in habitat loss in species extant distributions were observed from 1985 to 2002, which coincided with high national habitat loss rates. No significant differences were observed in the following LULC time series. According to the IUCN Red List, only 78 of our species are at risk. However, IUCN's criterion A only considers habitat loss in species extant distributions over the last 10 years, but if we consider the cumulative habitat loss from 1985 to 2014, 227 species lost >30% of their distribution. Thus, we suggest that the impact of cumulative habitat loss in species distributions should be considered when determining conservation threats. Furthermore, we analyzed the impact at each of Mexico's ecoregions, and found that habitat loss in species extant distributions appeared to be related to geographic locations of species distribution ranges rather than to the distribution area per se.

Hence, increasing habitat quality is often a primary goal of species conservation. Yet, assessments of fitness and density are difficult and costly to obtain. Therefore, species conservation often uses best available science, extending inferences across taxa, space, or time, and inferring habitat quality from studies of habitat selection. However, there are scenarios where habitat selection is not reflective of habitat quality, and this can lead to maladaptive management strategies. The New England cottontail (Sylvilagus transitionalis) is an imperiled shrubland obligate lagomorph whose successful recovery hinges on creation of suitable habitat. Recovery of this species is also negatively impacted by the non-native eastern cottontail (Sylvilagus floridanus), which can competitively exclude New England cottontails from preferred habitat. Herein, we evaluate habitat quality for adult and juvenile New England and eastern cottontails using survival and density as indicators. Our findings did not support selection following an ideal free distribution by New England cottontails. Instead, selected resources, which are a target of habitat management, were associated with low survival and density and pointed to a complex trade-off between density, survival, habitat, and the presence of eastern cottontails. Further, movement distance was inversely correlated with survival in both species, suggesting that habitat fragmentation limits the ability of cottontails to freely distribute based on habitat quality. While habitat did not directly regulate survival of juvenile cottontails, tick burden had a strong negative impact on juvenile cottontails in poor body condition. Given the complex interactions among New England cottontails, eastern cottontails, and habitat, directly assessing and accounting for factors that limit New England cottontail habitat quality in management plans is vital to their recovery. Our study demonstrates an example of management for possible ecological trap conditions via the application of incomplete knowledge.","[Cheeseman, Amanda E.; Cohen, Jonathan B.; Whipps, Christopher M.] SUNY Coll Environm Sci & Forestry, Dept Environm & Forest Biol, Syracuse, NY 13210 USA; [Ryan, Sadie J.] Univ Florida, Dept Geog, Quantitat Dis Ecol & Conservat QDEC Lab, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Ryan, Sadie J.] Univ Florida, Emerging Pathogens Inst, Gainesville, FL USA; [Ryan, Sadie J.] Univ KwaZulu Natal, Sch Life Sci, Durban, South Africa",acheesem@esf.edu,95,3,3,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

In spite of conservation efforts over 50 years, wild tigers now occupy <7% of their historic range. Reproducing tiger populations survive in <1% of the similar to 1.6 million km(2) potential habitat. Evaluating both successful and failed conservation efforts is critical to reversing tiger declines. Wild tiger populations are managed by governments under constraints imposed by other stake-holders. We review recoveries of tigers across a 38,000 km(2) area landscape matrix in Malenad region in southwestern India, during the past five decades. We examine data and empirical observations on tiger ecology, human impacts, emergent conflicts, as well as conservation interventions made at macro-ecological scales by the non-governmental project titled Malenad Tiger Program. We estimate that between 1970 and 2015, tiger habitat occupancy remained unchanged at 14,000 km(2), out of 21,000 km(2) of potential habitat in Malenad. However, tiger numbers rose from 70 to 391, only because of sporadic recoveries in a few wildlife reserves. We conclude that if tiger recovery efforts can be optimized in future, the Malenad landscape can potentially support 1300 wild tigers. We propose pragmatic strategies that may improve success rates and cost-effectiveness of future recovery efforts directed at tigers, and, generally at other threatened large carnivores. We evaluate both challenges and opportunities that non-governmental conservation programs must address to be effective in assisting tiger recoveries in the future.","[Karanth, K. Ullas; Kumar, N.

A thorough assessment would consider genetic variation in each species across the species range, but for most tree species, such information is simply not available. For this reason, we used spatial variation associated with Biogeoclimatic Ecosystem Classification zones (BEC zones) representing different macro climates as a proxy for adaptive genetic variation. We re-assessed the 2005 conservation status calculated in this manner using updated datasets collected in 2017, considered both in situ and ex situ conservation, and used an adjusted criterion for small-stature tree species. Results of our gap analysis revealed that overall, the native tree species in 89% of the conservation units (defined as species-by-biogeoclimatic-zone combinations) were well protected in situ. Of the 43 native tree species in the province, 12 species had conservation gaps in one or more biogeoclimatic zones. When in situ and ex situ conservation were considered jointly, the overall percentage of conservation units that were adequately protected improved to 91%. Needs for additional ex situ collections or in situ protection are discussed in terms of both BEC zones and individual species.

In this study, we presented a framework based on the ECR to guide PA network expansion, which identifies the areas requiring priority conservation and incorporates coordinated ecological conservation and social development. The framework consists of three steps: (1) design the network by identifying the hotspots of ecological function, ecological fragility and biodiversity, (2) transform the network from theory to practice through boundary verification, and (3) define a management policy with consideration of the livelihood of local communities.

Most of the species are locally distributed endemics confined to saline habitats either on the coastal ecosystems of the Mediterranean region or inland salt lakes. They are threatened by excessive grazing, habitat alterations and global warming. A concise taxonomic revision of Limonium in Turkey, covering 27 taxa (25 species and two varieties), is also presented including keys to the species and varieties. So far, three new endemic taxa, Limonium davisii, sp. nov., Limonium lilacinum var. laxiflorum, var. nov., and Limonium globuliferum var. subglobosum, var. nov., are described for the first time. The center of Limonium diversity, according to our survey, lies in the Mediterranean Irano-Turanian region, where 14 endemic taxa (seven of them known from one locality), seven non-endemic rare taxa and six widely distributed taxa are found.

It can be difficult, therefore, to disentangle the role of local ecology from anthropogenic factors, creating a risk of attributing a lack of gene flow as being due to human activities, leading to ill-informed management decisions. Here, we test the ecological and anthropogenic factors driving population differentiation and show how the relative influence of such effects can be identified. Using Bayesian clustering and a causal modelling approach, we combine genetic and remote sensing data to disentangle the confounding influences of ecological and anthropogenic fragmentation. We investigate a region where such confusion may arise; in and around the Okavango Delta in northern Botswana. Specifically, we used 20 microsatellites to investigate the genetic structuring of African lionsPanthera leooccupying a landscape dominated by two very different environments, the wetland Okavango and the surrounding Kalahari Desert. We find that differences in ecology, rather than anthropogenic barriers, are driving genetic differences in the population and that despite their ability to disperse long distances these lion populations are differentiated into two distinct genetic groups, one inhabiting the wetland Okavango Delta and the other one inhabiting the surrounding dryland Kalahari, divided by an apparently unobstructed boundary. The genetic structure observed could easily have been misinterpreted as a response to anthropogenic disturbance reducing gene flow. This reinforces the need to consider non-anthropogenic hypotheses, such as ecological differences between habitats, when assessing possible mechanisms of gene flow and their implications for population management. As anthropogenic pressure increases in this region, we recommend conservation managers consider the Okavango population as a separate conservation unit, but also recognize the importance of maintaining the current structural landscape connectivity.","[Dures, S.

In continuous cover forest management, this culminates in decisions about tree harvesting (or retention) determining both the prevalence of tree-related microhabitats in the forest and the economic viability of timber management. Applying an innovative mixed methods approach, we compare conservationists and foresters performing a tree selection exercise. We assess the outcomes of their forest management decisions quantitatively and explore their strategies and the underlying reasoning based on qualitative data. Our findings show that particularly the habitat trees differ greatly between the two groups: while conservationists retained almost exclusively large oaks at often high opportunity costs, foresters retained a notable number of smaller-diameter hornbeams. These differences are related to a different perception of opportunity costs of retention by both groups, as well as because they do not agree about how to value current tree-related microhabitats and their projection into the future. Such diverging patterns of reasoning imply incompatible interpretations of what constitutes a habitat tree. Our results indicate that it is important to apply benchmarks for evaluating ecological goals as well as to increase foresters' and conservationists' understanding about the motivations and restrictions of the respective counterpart.

The goals of this study are: (i) to document the temporary pond loss in a traditional pasture due to land abandonment (period of 2009-2018 and 2019), (ii) to explore the influence of shrub encroachment on the formation of temporary ponds, (iii) to document changes in amphibian species assemblages in the temporary ponds and (iv) to explore the socio-economic and environmental drivers of abandonment. The results show a dramatic increase of shrub cover in the study area as a result of land abandonment. The formation of temporary ponds was negatively influenced by the increase of shrub cover in the vicinity of ponds. The loss of temporary ponds had significant negative influence on the amphibian species assemblages in the remaining temporary ponds. The social component of the research highlights a social-ecological feedback consisting of village depopulation, incorrect interpretation of nature protection law by officials, shrub encroachment caused by the abandonment of grazing and the loss of local's motivations to restart traditional grazing due to the excessive shrub encroachment. A strong cooperation between farmers and conservation scientists can provide multiple benefits including conservation management of habitats, develop strategies for high nature value farming and tightening social-ecological links between locals and their pasture.

However, natural disturbances have largely disappeared from European boreal forests because of modern forestry practices and fire suppression. We currently lack knowledge on the foraging activity and resource use of the Eurasian Three-toed Woodpecker, especially in burned forests, and this restricts our ability to develop strategies for sustainable forest management and ecological restoration aiming at improving the situation of this woodpecker and associated species. In order to fill this knowledge gap, we studied the characteristics of selected foraging substrates and the foraging behavior of the Three-toed Woodpecker during the breeding season in unburned forests and forests that have been subjected to prescribed burning. We used instantaneous sampling during two consecutive springs (2016-2017), where we observed the woodpeckers' foraging behavior during a total of 977 minutes in burned forest and 962 minutes in unburned forests. The preferred foraging substrate for Three-toed Woodpeckers in both burned and unburned forests can be characterized as freshly dead trees with a DBH > 15 cm. However, data on time spent foraging on different substrates suggest that also substrates in the 5-15 DBH range and living trees are important. Additionally, prescribed burnings led to less pronounced selection of tree species, which suggest that fire may reduce differences in abundance of saproxylic insect prey between tree species. This information on substrate selection and foraging time provide complementary knowledge and thus should be used simultaneously when management strategies for improved woodpecker habitat are developed. Our results suggest that both prescribed burning and protecting forests with high density and diversity of dead wood provides habitat opportunities for Three-toed Woodpeckers and using both in management may maximize conservation outcome.","[Versluijs, Martijn; Roberge, Jean-Michel; Hjalten, Joakim] Swedish Univ Agr Sci SLU, Dept Wildlife Fish & Environm Studies, Umea, Sweden; [Eggers, Sonke] Swedish Univ Agr Sci SLU, Dept Ecol, Uppsala, Sweden; [Mikusinski, Grzegorz] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Ecol, Grimso Wildlife Res Stn, Riddarhyttan, Sweden; [Mikusinski, Grzegorz] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Sch Forest Management, Skinnskatteberg, Sweden; [Roberge, Jean-Michel] Swedish Forest Agcy, Umea, Sweden",martijn.versluijs@slu.se,77,0,0,RESILIENCE ALLIANCE,WOLFVILLE,"ACADIA UNIV, BIOLOGY DEPT, WOLFVILLE, NS B0P 1X0, CANADA",1712-6568,AVIAN CONSERV ECOL,Avian Conserv.

Conservation priority to safeguard its habitat usually treats L. polyphemus as a whole, without consideration of different intraspecific ecological requirements. We seek to identify intraspecific ecological niche divergence or conservatism in L. polyphemus. In this study, ocean and coastal environmental conditions occupied by the six distinct metapopulations of L. polyphemus were collected, and compared using correlative approaches, niche overlaps among these six metapopulations were compared with geographical and genetic distances, the realized niche divergence/conservatism among these six metapopulations were tested, and ecological niche models were fitted for the six metapopulations separately and for L. polyphemus as a whole using state-of-the-art techniques. We found that mean sea surface temperature, tidal regime, chlorophyll a concentration, distance to shore and depth of seafloor were limiting factors in the geographic distribution of L. polyphemus. In addition to the former hypothesis that tidal amplitude and type account for the absence of L. polyphemus in the western Gulf of Mexico, our niche model predictions suggest that the narrow and high-depth seafloor in the western Gulf of Mexico also explain the absence. We found that realized niche overlaps among six metapopulations were not correlated with their geographic and genetic distances; rather the six metapopulations each occupied a unique combination of habitat conditions, showing different responses to environmental factors, although these divergences might be due a background effect. Results here showed that the distribution of one metapopulation of L. polyphemus cannot be inferred from changes in distribution of another, highlighting the inadequacy of one-size-fits-all conservation actions. We recommend that conservation priority assignment by IUCN and Natureserve for L. polyphemus would better consider the six metapopulations separately rather than L. polyphemus as a whole, which will deliver more useful information on guiding regional conservation efforts.

We investigated the status of this species, its potential distribution, habitat selection (at multiple spatial scales) and activity patterns in Mali and Burkina Faso, two countries within the tortoise' known range. We employed field surveys and villager interviews in 23 sites to determine the presence of the species. In these surveys and interviews, we also included the Western hinge-back tortoise (Kinixys nogueyi), a sympatric chelonian also suspected of being in decline. Age-stratified interviews revealed that C. sulcata is widespread in Mali, but since there was a statistically higher frequency of older respondents that remembered C. sulcata present around their village, compared to younger respondents, it is likely that the species has been declining throughout the study area. We encountered a total 77 C. sulcata and 20 K. nogueyi individuals during our field surveys. Most C. sulcata were found along areas of intermittent streams and stabilised dunes, known locally as koris. Centrochelys sulcata individuals were more likely to occur in sandy dry savannah areas that were further away from human settlements, and which contained inland waters or were closer to these. Kinixys nogueyi exhibited instead an allopatric distribution, with no ascertained sympatry with C. sulcata at the microhabitat scale. Cattle incidence was negatively correlated with the presence by C. sulcata. Our results also indicate that aboveground activity of C. sulcata is limited to the wet season and has a clearly bimodal diel activity cycle, with most sightings in the early morning hours. We provide suggestions on how best to survey this species in the wild while advancing new information on its distribution and biology.

Progress in documenting the ecological effects of sensory pollutants is weakened by sparse knowledge of the mechanisms underlying these effects. This severely limits our capacity to devise mitigation measures.

We then link these three mechanisms to ecological consequences and discuss their implications for conservation. We argue that this framework can reveal the presence of 'sensory danger zones', hotspots of conservation concern where sensory pollutants overlap in space and time with an organism's activity, and foster development of strategic interventions to mitigate the impact of sensory pollutants. Future research that applies this framework will provide critical insight to preserve the natural sensory world.","[Dominoni, Davide M.] Univ Glasgow, Inst Biodivers Anim Hlth & Comparat Med, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland; [Dominoni, Davide M.] Netherlands Inst Ecol NIOO KNAW, Dept Anim Ecol, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Halfwerk, Wouter] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Sect Anim Ecol, Dept Ecol Sci, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Baird, Emily] Stockholm Univ, Dept Zool, Stockholm, Sweden; [Buxton, Rachel T.; Seymoure, Brett M.] Colorado State Univ, Dept Fish Wildlife & Conservat Biol, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Fernandez-Juricic, Esteban] Purdue Univ, Dept Biol Sci, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Fristrup, Kurt M.; McKenna, Megan F.] Natl Pk Serv, Nat Sounds & Night Skies Div, Ft Collins, CO USA; [Mennitt, Daniel J.] Exponent, Mech Engn Practice, Denver, CO USA; [Perkin, Elizabeth K.] Hatfield Consultants, Environm Monitoring & Assessment Grp, Calgary, AB, Canada; [Stoner, David C.] Utah State Univ, Dept Wildland Resources, Logan, UT 84322 USA; [Tennessen, Jennifer B.] Washington Univ, Dept Biol, Bellingham, WA USA; [Toth, Cory A.] Canadian Wildlife Serv, Environm & Climate Change Canada, Gatineau, PQ, Canada; [Tyrrell, Luke P.] SUNY Coll Plattsburgh, Dept Biol Sci, Plattsburgh, NY 12901 USA; [Wilson, Ashley; Francis, Clinton D.] Calif Polytech State Univ San Luis Obispo, Dept Biol Sci, San Luis Obispo, CA 93407 USA; [Carter, Neil H.] Univ Michigan, Sch Environm & Sustainabil, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Barber, Jesse R.] Boise State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Boise, ID 83725 USA",davide.dominoni@glasgow.ac.uk,100,60,60,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",2397-334X,NAT ECOL EVOL,Nat.

In particular, human-provisioned food subsidies represent a serious concern for the conservation of apex predators, even though little empirical attention has been given to this aspect in assessing conservation outcomes. To assess the extent to which anthropogenic food subsidies affected feeding ecology of a protected wolf (Canis lupus) population in a human-modified landscape, we integrated scat-analysis (n = 1141 from 4 packs; Jan 2005-Mar 2009) and winter field inspections of Global Positioning System telemetry re-locations (n = 595 clusters and 96 single locations from 5 wolves in 5 packs and 3 floaters; 2008-2011) of wolves living in a historical national park of central Italy hosting both wild prey and livestock at high densities. We revealed that livestock dominated the wolf diet (mean biomass = 63.3 +/- 14.2% SD), secondarily supplemented by wild prey (36.7 +/- 5.3%, mostly wild boar [Sus scrofa], roe deer [Capreolus capreolus], and red deer [Cervus elaphus]). During winter, we revealed a higher propensity of wolves to scavenge (72.5%; n = 91 feeding events) rather than killing prey, and feeding behavior was affected by prey type (i.e., domestic vs wild ungulates) as the large majority of scavenged carrions (75.8%) were livestock carcasses abandoned on the ground that died for causes different from predation. Feeding behavior of wolves was not affected by social affiliation (i.e., pack members vs solitary wolves), indicating that pack members, even if aided by cooperative hunting, were equally likely than solitary wolves to scavenge rather than killing prey; yet, 27.5% of winter feeding events involved predation, exclusively targeted to wild prey. Our findings indicate that large livestock carrion subsidies may strongly depress predatory behavior in wolves, despite the occurrence of an abundant wild prey community, and have relevant ecological, evolutionary and management implications. Reliance on human-provided livestock carrion subsidies likely alters the ecological role of wolves by reducing their top-down cascading effects on the ecosystem, and this has relevant implications for the conservation of wolves and other apex predators in national parks. Accordingly, we call for more strict regulations to govern live-stock management and practices and argue that, at least in national parks, conservation goals of apex predators need to explicitly consider their ecological role.

Case studies around the world have demonstrated that merging indigenous hunting knowledge with community-based conservation approaches is often complementary to biodiversity conservation. A combination of such approaches improves wildlife conservation practices and livelihood strategies while enhancing communities' social-ecological resilience. However, if mismanaged, such approaches lead to negative results in the community, such as an increased exposure/vulnerability to corruption, power inequality among interest groups, as well as mismanagement of wildlife species. We explore the existence of hunting-specific traditional ecological knowledge and the contribution of such knowledge to wildlife management in the case of community-based conservation in Tajikistan. We reviewed hunting-related literature from 1850 to 1950, conducted interviews, and accompanied hunters in the field to document their ecological knowledge of the Gomo-Badakhshan Autonomous Oblast (GBAO), also known as the Pamir region of Tajikistan. Throughout our research, we found that there exists a rich body of hunter-specific ecological knowledge of hunting norms, ethics, taboos, and belief systems in the Pamir region of Tajikistan. Traditional hunters largely accepted a community-based conservation approach because it resonates with their subsistence hunting practices. Also, combining traditional hunter knowledge with a community-based conservation approach created an opportunity for knowledge sharing, improved the quality of scientific wildlife surveys, and led to better collaboration among conservancies and other conservation NGOs. More importantly, such approaches empowered and incentivized local traditional hunters to take responsibility for wildlife management.","[Shokirov, Qobiljon; Backhaus, Norman] Univ Zurich, Dept Geog, Zurich, Switzerland; [Backhaus, Norman] Univ Zurich, Univ Prior Programme Global Change & Biodivers, Zurich, Switzerland",,68,6,6,RESILIENCE ALLIANCE,WOLFVILLE,"ACADIA UNIV, BIOLOGY DEPT, WOLFVILLE, NS B0P 1X0, CANADA",1708-3087,ECOL SOC,Ecol.

The goals of this study are to examine food choice and to identify the nutritional profile of foods consumed by the Critically Endangered black snub-nosed monkey (Rhinopithecus strykeri). To accomplish our study goals, we presented cafeteria-style feeding trials of fresh food items collected in the home range of wild black snub-nosed monkeys to the only two captive R. strykeri, and compared the nutritional profiles of the leafy foods (buds, young, and mature leaves, 100 i23tems from 70 plant species) selected with those avoided (54 items from 48 plant species). Overall, the results indicate that captive R. strykeri selected foods that were higher in moisture (Mo; 77.7%), crude protein (CP; 21.2%), total nonstructural carbohydrates (TNC; 34.9%), and phosphorus (P; 0.37%) while tending to avoid foods with a neutral detergent fiber (NDF) content of greater than 46.8%. Leaves collected in autumn and selected by the monkeys were characterized by a slightly higher amount of metabolizable energy (ME) than those rejected (1,350 kJ/100 g vs. 1,268 kJ/100 g). In contrast, the protein content of foods collected and consumed during the spring was greater (22.9%) than in autumn (16.4%). Random Forests modeling, an ensemble learning method, indicated that the proportion of Mo, NDF, ME, CP, P, and TNC were among the most important factors in predicting which items were consumed by the captive R. strykeri during spring and autumn. On the basis of the nutritional profile of foods consumed across the two seasons, we identified 18 nutrient-rich native plant species that we recommend for use in ex- and in-situ conservation management and reforestation programs to provide long-term access to a nutritionally adequate diet.","[Yang, Yin; Ren, Guopeng; Huang, Zhipang; Xiao, Wen] Dali Univ, Inst Eastern Himalaya Biodivers Res, Dali 671003, Yunnan, Peoples R China; [Yang, Yin; Behie, Alison] Australian Natl Univ, Sch Archaeol & Anthropol, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia; [Yang, Yin; Ren, Guopeng; Huang, Zhipang; Xiao, Wen] Three Parallel Rivers Region China, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Biodivers & Conservat, Dali, Yunnan, Peoples R China; [Li, Qihua] Yunnan Agr Univ, Yunnan Prov Key Lab Anim Nutr & Feed Sci, Kunming, Yunnan, Peoples R China; [Garber, Paul A.] Univ Illinois, Dept Anthropol, Program Ecol Evolut & Conservat Biol, Urbana, IL USA; [Grueter, Cyril C.] Univ Western Australia, Sch Human Sci, Perth, WA, Australia; [Grueter, Cyril C.] Univ Western Australia, Sch Biol Sci, Ctr Evolutionary Biol, Perth, WA, Australia; [Wang, Xinwen] Lushui Bur Gaoligongshan Natl Nat Reserve, Liuku, Yunnan, Peoples R China; [Xiang, Zuofu] Cent South Univ Forestry & Technol, Inst Evolutionary Ecol & Conservat Biol, Changsha, Hunan, Peoples R China",xiaow@eastern-himalaya.cn; alison.behie@anu.edu.au,76,4,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0275-2565,AM J PRIMATOL,Am.

It is significantly influences on the ecological security and sustainable development of the region. Soil conservation (SC) service, as one of the most important regulating services provided by ecosystems, can alter soil and water processes and improve ecosystem services that ensure human welfare. Investigations of spatial and temporal characteristics of SC service play important roles in soil erosion control and ecosystem protection in AUMYR. In the past several years, restoration projects (e.g. the Grain-for-Green project) were implemented to improve SC in most of AUMYR. It is needed to evaluate the change of SC service brought about by the projects. This study carries out quantitative spatial analysis of SC services through Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE) model and geographic information system (GIS) manipulation based on various datasets, such as remote sensing image, digital elevation model (DEM), climate, and land use/cover maps. Soil retention calculated as potential soil erosion (erosion without vegetation cover) minus actual soil erosion was applied as indicator for SC service. The results are like these. (1) The total amount and mean capacity of SC service in AUMYR were 7.22 billion t/a and 142.2 t/hm(2).a in 2000 and 10.19 billion t/a and 200.8 t/hm(2).a in 2010, respectively. South-east AUMYR exhibited a much higher capacity of soil retaining than the north-west. (2) Forest ecosystems displayed higher SC capacity than other types of ecosystems. Moreover, the SC capacity of ecosystems increased with the increasing of slope gradient. (3) Variations of SC rate (the ratio of SC to potential soil erosion in percentage) in different units (ecosystem, slope zone and city) were relatively small and ca. 90% of potentially eroded soil was retained in AUMYR. (4) The spatial characteristics of SC service in AUMYR were primarily controlled by topography at the regional scale. Vegetation cover restoration significantly improved the capacity of SC service in AUMYR in the midst year of 2000 and 2010. The results revealed that ecological restoration efforts significantly enhanced SC service of ecosystem in the study area.","[Zhu, Mingyong; Xiong, Yongzhu] Jiaying Univ, Sch Geog & Tourism, Meizhou 514015, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [He, Wenming] Jiaying Univ, Sch Chem & Environm, Meizhou 514015, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Quanfa] Chinese Acad Sci, Wuhan Bot Garden, Key Lab Aquat Bot & Watershed Ecol, Wuhan 430074, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Tan, Shuduan] Hunan City Univ, Coll Architecture & Urban Planning, Yiyang 413000, Peoples R China; [He, Hongming] Northwest Agr & Forestry Univ, State Key Lab Soil Eros & Dryland Farming Loess P, Inst Soil & Water Conservat, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [He, Hongming] Chinese Acad Sci, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [He, Hongming] Minist Water Resources, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China",hongming.he@yahoo.com,48,9,10,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",,HELIYON,Heliyon,2019,"gold, Green Published",

Using floristic data collected at 602 sites in the western Canadian boreal forest, we studied relationships between rare species occurrence, species richness and habitat type, with rarity defined according to the classification system developed by Rabinowitz (in: Synge (ed) The biological aspects of rare plant conservation, Wiley, Somerset, 1981). Relative to similar studies in other temperate regions, we found that a smaller proportion of species were classified as rare in our study region, and that common species dominate the flora. Regional-scale relationships were positive between richness and the occurrence of rare species; however, due to variation in these relationships among habitat types, richness is not a suitable surrogate for a site's conservation value with respect to species rarity.","[Crisfield, Varina E.] Royal Alberta Museum, 9810 103A Ave, Edmonton, AB T5J 0G2, Canada; [Crisfield, Varina E.] Univ Alberta, Alberta Biodivers Monitoring Inst, CW405 Biol Sci Bldg, Edmonton, AB T6G 2E9, Canada; [Dennett, Jacqueline M.; Denny, Catherine K.; Mao, Lingfeng; Nielsen, Scott E.] Univ Alberta, Dept Renewable Resources, 751 Gen Serv Bldg, Edmonton, AB T6G 2H1, Canada",Varina.Crisfield@gov.ab.ca,66,1,1,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0960-3115,BIODIVERS CONSERV,Biodivers.

To move towards more inclusive conservation policies that take these two aspects into account, research is required in indigenous settings that can inform policy makers. The present study, carried out in the lowland Maya area of Mexico, aims to investigate local meanings of rainforest conservation and dynamics of land use in two Maya common property holdings or 'ejidos' (Noh cah and X-Maben). The study used a Social-Ecological Systems approach comprising: (i) the Maya communities and their local meanings of conservation as a Social Subsystem, assessed through social surveys, and (ii) the rainforest of each studied ejido - which was regarded as an Ecological Subsystem and assessed through satellite images (from 2000 to 2012). In the former, interviewees were asked: when you hear the phrase 'conservation of the rainforest' what do you think is being said? They were also asked if there were local words in Maya or Spanish that were similar in meaning to the aforementioned phrase. The results relating to the meanings of conservation demonstrate that Maya people, who rely on the rainforest for multiple livelihoods, understand two types of meanings for looking after the rainforest; one promoted by governmental conservation programs, and the other called Kanan K'aax, a Maya phrase that represents their customary or community-based rainforest conservation. Differences between these two models of conservation encompass differences with respect to scale, gender and the Maya people's own cultural practices. The results of the local dynamics of land use demonstrate that the landscapes of both study sites are dominated by mature rainforest (ranging from 73.9-82.7%), and are therefore in a good state of conservation, and that their agricultural frontiers have not expanded. Our empirical results are valuable in terms of informing the scientific community about the state of rainforest conservation in the Maya Zone, and providing policy makers (from the Maya area and elsewhere) with information to devise new, more inclusive conservation policies that take full account of the indigenous cultural practices of rainforest management.","[Arce-Ibarra, A.

It is important to work out and strengthen new measures to overcome difficulties to promote more ecosystem services and human well-being in the NFCP. This study focused on how to evaluate the ecosystem services change brought about by implementing the NFCP. Taking the key state-owned forest areas in the Northeast and Inner Mongolia as the study area, we provide a basic overview of development and construct an evaluation index system and a distributed calculation method for the NFCP to analyze the implications of the NFCP on ecosystem services combined with multi-source data coupling. An evaluation index system for NFCP ecosystem services was constructed. The system includes five ecological service functions and 12 evaluation indices. The trade-off and/or synergistic analysis of ecosystem services were carried out. The regional characteristics and changes in the NFCP ecosystem services were emphasized. Although it has not been implemented for a long time, the NFCP has had a great impact on ecosystem services because it reduces soil and water losses, increases soil fertility, strengthens the forest carbon sink and helped the forest accumulate nutrients and purify the atmosphere. Socioeconomic factors affect the NFCP ecosystem services, such as the implementation area of NFCP, investment amount of NFCP, area ratio of nature reserves, and yield of tree stock volume. Policy drivers of the NFCP, changes in the economic structure and reductions in forest yield are the main factors affecting the change in NFCP ecosystem services. Although the NFCP has positively affected the society, the economy, and the ecological environment, it has also generated some problems, such as the improper management of forest resources, shortage of capital investment, staff transfer, etc. The social and economic problems will be transient with implementation of the NFCP, and the structural changes in forestry and agriculture may eventually benefit the forestry workers and other stakeholders.","[Huang, Longsheng; Wang, Bing; Niu, Xiang; Song, Qingfeng] Chinese Acad Forestry, State Forestry Adm, Key Lab Forest Ecol & Environm, Res Inst Forest Ecol Environm & Protect, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Huang, Longsheng; Wang, Bing; Niu, Xiang; Song, Qingfeng] Beijing Collaborat Innovat Ctr Ecoenvironm Improv, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Gao, Peng] Shandong Agr Univ, State Forestry Adm, Mt Tai Forest Ecosyst Res Stn, Shandong Prov Key Lab Soil Eros & Ecol Restorat, Tai An, Shandong, Peoples R China",wangbingcfern@163.com; niuxiang@caf.ac.cn,64,15,16,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

We explore outcomes and tradeoffs for the proposed expansion of a US wildlife refuge in a region characterized by strong town character and high human population density, development, and property values. Objectives Our objectives were to: (1) determine whether acquisition targets could be achieved given competing objectives; (2) evaluate tradeoffs between social, economic, and ecological objectives; and (3) evaluate how landscape development influences tradeoffs. Methods We used genetic algorithms to generate and evaluate outcomes for refuge expansion that could systematically navigate multi-objective tradeoffs. Ecological objectives included maximizing total protected habitat, priority habitats, and connectivity between protected properties. Economic and social objectives included minimizing acquisition cost, loss of areas under high development pressure, and town character conflict. Results Land acquisition targets could be met, though not without economic and social tradeoffs. Positive outcomes for area protected and connectivity resulted in poor outcomes for the other four objectives. Win-win refuge expansion solutions were available for some objectives, but there were also consistent tradeoff relationships, which were exacerbated in areas with high development pressure. Conclusion This multi-objective approach allows decision makers to account for tradeoffs and hard choices between social-ecological objectives.

To acknowledge this need, we propose the term ecological renovation to describe ecological management and nature conservation actions that actively allow for environmental change. To evaluate and progress the development of ecological renovation and related intervention options in a climate change context, we reviewed the literature and established a typology of options that have been proposed. We explored how these options address emerging principles underpinning climate-adapted conservation goals and whether the balance of approaches reflected in our typology is likely to be sufficient given expected rapid rates of climate change. Our typology recognizes a matrix of 23 intervention option types arranged on the basis of underpinning ecological mechanisms (ameliorate changing conditions or build adaptive capacity) on one axis, and the nature of the tools used to manipulate them (low regrets or climate targeted) on the other. Despite a burgeoning literature since 2008, we found that the majority of effort has consistently focused on low-regrets adaptation approaches that aim to build adaptive capacity. This is in many ways desirable, but a paradigm shift enabling greater attention to climate-targeted approaches is likely to be needed as climate change accelerates. When assessed against five emerging principles for setting nature conservation goals in a changing climate, only one option type could deliver to all five, and we identified a conflict between climate-targeted options and wildness values that calls for deeper evaluation. Importantly, much of the inference in the 473 reviewed studies was drawn from ecological reasoning and modeling, with only 16% offering new empirical evidence. We also noted significant biases toward North America and Europe, forest ecosystems, trees, and vertebrates. To address these limitations and help shift the paradigm toward humans as renovators rather than restorers of a prior world, we propose that ecological researchers contribute by (1) informing societal discourse toward adapting nature conservation goals to climate change, (2) adjusting and upscaling conservation planning to accommodate this suite of climate-adapted goals, and (3) reconceptualizing experimental approaches to increase empirical evidence and expedite innovation of tools to address change.","[Prober, Suzanne M.] CSIRO Land & Water, Private Bag 5, Wembley, WA 6913, Australia; [Doerr, Veronica A.

Interest in restoring this iconic species and their ecological role in grassland ecosystems is rapidly gaining momentum. To evaluate the potential for bison to enhance habitat quality for wildlife and catalyze public engagement in grassland conservation, we assessed both the ecological and social effects of a recent bison reintroduction (2015) to northern Colorado. Specifically, we explored the effect of bison reintroduction on: (a) bird density and habitat use, (b) mammal habitat use, (c) vegetation composition and structure, and (d) visitor connectedness, known as place attachment, to a shortgrass prairie. We predicted that bison reintroduction would reduce cover and height of some grasses and shrubs, which would increase density and habitat use for obligate shortgrass prairie birds, and increase habitat use for coyote and lagomorphs. In addition, we predicted that visitors would express stronger place attachment to this grassland once bison were reintroduced. To measure ecological and social responses, we surveyed birds, mammals, and plants; and conducted structured visitor surveys before and after bison reintroduction. We found few short-term effects of bison on grassland bird density and habitat use, mammal habitat use, and vegetation composition and structure. However, we measured a significant increase in visitor place attachment to the grassland site 1 year after bison reintroduction. Our results suggest that a new bison reintroduction may have immediate positive benefits for connecting people to conservation, and that the ecological and social effects may unfold over different time scales. We recommend that future bison reintroduction efforts monitor ecological and social outcomes to advance reintroduction biology.","[Wilkins, Kate] Colorado State Univ, Grad Degree Program Ecol, 1474 Campus Delivery, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Pejchar, Liba] Colorado State Univ, Dept Fish Wildlife & Conservat Biol, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Garvoille, Rebecca] Denver Zoo, Dept Conservat & Res, Denver, CO USA; [Garvoille, Rebecca] BBC Res & Consulting, 1999 Broadway,Suite 2200, Denver, CO 80202 USA",kate.wilkins@colostate.edu,53,3,3,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",,CONSERV SCI PRACT,Conserv.

Therefore, a 3-year (2013-2015) field study was conducted to assess tillage modification effects on productivity and soil C sequestration under RRS at ICAR- RC for North Eastern Hill Region, Tripura, India. The experimental site represented two different ecologies: unsubmerged (ECO 1) and submerged (ECO 2), with three tillage practices: conventional tillage (CT), reduced tillage (RT) and no-till (NT). Results showed that the cultivation of RRS under RT produced significantly higher grain (8.6-9.4 Mg ha(-1)) and straw (11.8-12.9 Mg ha(-1)) yields under both ecologies over those under CT and RT, in addition to recycling the maximum biomass. Soil under RT had lower bulk density (rho(b)), the highest soil organic carbon (SOC) concentration, pool, sequestration, accumulation, carbon retention efficiency, soil microbial biomass carbon and dehydrogenase activities under both ecologies as compared to CT. A total amount of 1.34 Mg C ha(-1) was accumulated under soils of RT over 3 years. The rate of SOC sequestration ranged from 133.6 kg ha(-1) year(-1) under soils of CT to 444.7 kg ha(-1) year(-1) under RT in RRS. Thus, cultivation of RRS under RT with effective residue recycling is recommended for higher system productivity and C sequestration under both rice production ecologies of the NEH region of India.","[Yadav, Gulab Singh; Das, Anup; Bhowmik, S.

Ecological connectivity governs the exchange of individuals among spatially fragmented habitats and is often highlighted as an important element in the design of MPAs. However, the degree to which measured or modelled representations of connectivity are applied to marine management decisions worldwide remains unclear. We reviewed the scientific and management literature to explore the application of connectivity in MPAs located in six countries or regions with advanced marine spatial planning. Only 11% of the 746 MPAs we examined considered connectivity as an ecological criterion, increasingly so since 2007. Landscape measures such as habitat linkages were used most frequently by managers and genetic and modelling approaches by scientists. Of the MPAs that considered connectivity, 71% were for state marine conservation areas or reserves in California and commonwealth marine reserves in Australia. This pattern indicates substantial geographic bias. We propose that the incorporation of connectivity in conservation planning needs to become more accessible to practitioners and provide four recommendations that together will allow scientists and managers to bridge this gap: 1. determine whether to prioritize connectivity as an ecological criterion, 2. identify the role of an MPA in supporting connectivity, 3. identify the appropriate spatial and temporal scale of connectivity, and 4. improve regional knowledge of connectivity patterns. We also propose a framework to facilitate the communication of metrics and patterns of connectivity between scientists and practitioners to apply the best available information in the design and adaptive management of MPAs and networks of MPAs.

Consequently, many protected areas are ineffective 'paper parks' that contribute little towards conserving ecosystems. Poaching can be prevented through enforcement and engaging with community members so they support protected areas. It is not clear how much needs to be spent on enforcement and engagement to ensure they are frequent enough to be effective at conserving biodiversity. We develop models of enforcement against illegal fishing in marine protected areas. We apply the models to data on fishing rates and fish biomass from a marine protected area in Raja Ampat, Indonesia and explore how frequent enforcement patrols need to be to achieve targets for coral reef fish biomass. Achieving pristine levels of reef fish biomass required almost year-round enforcement of the protected area. Surveillance of the protected area may also be enhanced if local fishers who support the reserve report on poaching. The opportunity for local fishing boats to participate in surveillance was too small for it to have much benefit for total reef fish biomass, which increases slowly. However, specific functional groups of fish have much higher population growth rates and their biomass was predicted to increase markedly with community surveillance. We conclude that budgets for park management must balance the cost of conducting frequent patrols against supporting alternative activities, like education to build community support. Optimized budgets will be much more likely to achieve ecological targets for recovering fish biomasses and will contribute to fiscal sustainability of protected areas.","[Brown, Christopher J.; Parker, Brett] Griffith Univ, Australian Rivers Inst, 170 Kessels Rd, Nathan, Qld 4111, Australia; [Ahmadia, Gabby N.] World Wildlife Fund, Oceans Conservat, 1250 24th St, Washington, DC 20037 USA; [Ardiwijaya, Rizya] Nature Conservancy, Indonesia Program, Graha Iskandarsyah 3rd Fl, Jakarta 12160, Indonesia; [Purwanto] Univ Papua, Inst Res & Community Serv, Ctr Excellence, Jl Gunung Salju Amban Manokwari, West Papua 98314, Indonesia; [Game, Edward T.] Nature Conservancy, Asia Pacific Resource Ctr, 48 Montague Rd, South Brisbane, Qld 4101, Australia",chris.brown@griffith.edu.au; brett.parker3@griffithuni.edu.au; Gabby.Ahmadia@wwfus.org; rardiwijaya@tnc.org; purwanto.marine@gmail.com; egame@tnc.org,31,10,10,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0006-3207,BIOL CONSERV,Biol.

Although peripheral populations are often assumed to occur in ecologically marginal conditions, little is known about whether they effectively occur in a distinct ecological niche. A cross-taxa analysis of 11 Mediterranean vascular plants were studied. We quantified variation in the ecological niche between populations at the northern range limits of species in Mediterranean France and those in the central part of the distribution in continental Spain or Italy in 2013-2014. We analyzed both the macro-ecological niche where populations occur in terms of broad habitat and altitudinal range and the micro-ecological niche where individual plants grow in terms of soil and structural biotic and abiotic characteristics. Most species occur in a single broad habitat type common to central and peripheral populations and have a narrower altitudinal range in the latter. In contrast, for the micro-ecological niche we detected marked variation in several niche parameters among central and peripheral populations. Although many differences are species-specific some are common to several species. We found a trend towards narrower micro-niche breadth in peripheral populations. Our results illustrate the importance of studying the precise ecological characteristics where plants grow and the pertinence of a multi-species approach to correctly assess niche variation. The ecological originality of peripheral populations underlines their evolutionary potential and conservation significance.","[Papuga, G.; Farris, E.] Univ Sassari, Dipto Sci Nat & Terr, Sassari, Italy; [Papuga, G.] Conservatoire Bot Natl Mediterraneen Porquerolles, Antenne Languedoc Roussillon, Montferrier Sur Lez, France; [Papuga, G.; Gauthier, P.; Pons, V.; Thompson, J.

Here, we applied a range of ecological criteria to assess areas of biodiversity importance in the Coral Triangle region, a priority region for marine biodiversity conservation because of its high species richness and endemicity. We used distribution data of three biogenic habitats to assess the criterion of sensitive habitat, modeled geographic distributions of 10,672 species ranges and occurrence records of 19,251 species to evaluate the criterion of species richness, distributions of 834 species of special conservation concern to examine the criterion of species of conservation concern, distributions of 373 reef fish species to assess the criterion of restricted-range species, and distribution of nesting sites and migratory route of six species of sea turtle to evaluate the criterion of areas of importance for particular life history stages. We identified areas of biodiversity importance by superimposing each of the different criterion. We performed two tiers of multi criteria analysis: (1) a Coral Triangle regional level analysis to identify clustered hotspots (i.e., groups of cells) of biodiversity significance, and (2) a site-based analysis to identify the specific sites (cells) of greatest biodiversity importance. We found that approximately 13% of the Coral Triangle was clustered into hotspots of high biodiversity importance. These areas occurred along the southern part of the Philippines, the north-eastern part of Malaysian Sabah, central to eastern reaches of Indonesia, the eastern part of Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands. By comparison, the site-based analysis identified seven sites of highest biodiversity importance in the Coral Triangle include: (1) the northern tip of Sulawesi Island, (2) Ambon Island, (3) Kei Islands, (4) Raja Ampat Archipelago of Indonesian Papua, (5) the Verde Island Passage, (6) the southern part of Negros Island, and (7) Cebu Island.

As much as every modern human society depends on a network of settlements that is well-connected by transport infrastructure (i.e., settlement network), animal and plant species depend on networks of habitats between which they can move (i.e., habitat networks). However, changes to a settlement network in a region often threaten the integrity of the region's habitat networks. Determining plans and policy to prevent these threats is made difficult by the numerous interactions and feedbacks that exist between and within the settlement and habitat networks. Mathematical models of coupled settlement and habitat networks can help us understand the dynamics of this social-ecological system. Yet, few attempts have been made to develop such mathematical models. In this paper, we promote the development of models of coupled settlement and habitat networks for biodiversity conservation. First, we present a conceptual framework of key variables that are ideally considered when operationalizing the coupling of settlement and habitat networks. In this framework, we first describe important network-internal interactions by differentiating between the structural (i.e., relating to purely physical conditions determining the suitability of a location for living or movement) and functional (i.e., relating to the actual presence, abundance or movement of people or other organisms) properties of either network. We then describe the main one-way influences that a settlement network can exert on the habitat networks and vice versa. Second, we give several recommendations for the mathematical modeling of coupled settlement and habitat networks and present several existing modeling approaches (e.g., habitat network models and land-use transport interaction models) that could be used for this purpose. Lastly, we elaborate on potential applications of models of coupled settlement and habitat networks in the development of complex network theory, in the assessment of system resilience and in conservation, transport and urban planning. The development of coupled settlement and habitat network models is important to gain a better system-level understanding of biodiversity conservation under a rapidly urbanizing and growing human population.","[van Strien, Maarten J.; Gret-Regamey, Adrienne; Khiali-Miab, Amin; Ortiz-Rodriguez, Damian O.] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Civil Environm & Geomat Engn, Planning Landscape & Urban Syst, Zurich, Switzerland; [Axhausen, Kay W.; Dubernet, Ilka] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Transport Planning & Syst, Dept Civil Environm & Geomat Engn, Zurich, Switzerland; [Guisan, Antoine] Univ Lausanne, Dept Ecol & Evolut, Lausanne, Switzerland; [Guisan, Antoine] Univ Lausanne, Inst Earth Surface Dynam, Lausanne, Switzerland; [Ortiz-Rodriguez, Damian O.; Holderegger, Rolf] WSL Swiss Fed Res Inst, Biodivers & Conservat Biol, Birmensdorf, Switzerland; [Holderegger, Rolf] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Integrat Biol, Dept Environm Syst Sci, Zurich, Switzerland",maarten@vstrien.nl,181,2,2,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",2296-701X,FRONT ECOL EVOL,Front.

While state-authorised and state-directed forms of violence in support of conservation have been evident in many places for quite some time, the current scope, scale and rhetorical justification of the violent defence of biodiversity seem quite unprecedented in the history of global conservation. We, therefore, ask whether and how the term green wars may be appropriate to describe this new intensity of violence and the changes in environmental governance it signifies. In bringing together a number of important recent discussions around green grabbing, green militarisation/violence, green economy, neoliberal conservation and biopower, amongst others, the special issue emphasises the increasingly central role of environmental and conservation concerns within the global political economy as a whole. In the process, it also points towards an overarching conceptual framing for understanding these conjoined dynamics in terms of an 'intensification of pressure' precipitated by the combined yet uneven magnification and integration of power and capital within the world today. Consequently, we argue that the concept of green wars potentially heralds the new twenty-first century 'real-politik' of the centrality of violence and conflict both to the neoliberal political economy and to environmental conservation, and their integrated socio-ecological manifestations and effects.","[Buscher, Bram; Fletcher, Robert] Wageningen Univ, Sociol Dev & Change, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Buscher, Bram] Univ Johannesburg, Dept Geog Environm Management & Energy Studies, Johannesburg, South Africa",bram.buscher@wur.nl,67,37,36,WOLTERS KLUWER MEDKNOW PUBLICATIONS,MUMBAI,"WOLTERS KLUWER INDIA PVT LTD , A-202, 2ND FLR, QUBE, C T S  NO 1498A-2 VILLAGE MAROL, ANDHERI EAST, MUMBAI, 400059, INDIA",0972-4923,CONSERV SOC,Conserv.

Seeking to extend dialogue between scholars of biopolitics, of political ecology, and of both, then, this article surveys both new and shifting contours of the various ways in which contemporary political ecologies increasingly compel us to bring the very lives of various human and nonhuman populations, as Foucault once put it, into the realm of explicit calculations.

However, the ecological response to the SISGC still remains unclear on the national scale. Here, we used systematic sampling, and satellite image time series data revealed a widespread proliferation of major ecological indicators for grasslands, contrasting climate and actual net primary productivity (NPP) before (2004-2010) and after (2011-2017) the implementation of SISGC founded the contributions to policy, as simulated by the Carnegie-Ames-Stanford-Approach (CASA) model. On average, by two-phase comparison, the actual grassland NPP increased by 11.72%. The contribution of policy implementation and climate factors increased grassland NPP by up to 61.14% and 38.86%, respectively, but the response of the NPP growth of various grassland types exhibited divergence, mainly divided into policy-led (contribution rate of 52.28-97.02%) and climate-led (contribution rate of 57.56-96.00%).

Although numerous studies have evaluated the multifunctional benefits of urban green space, few of them have determined the differentiated conservation priorities of UGS towards the tradeoff relationship of multiple UGS functions. Here, we proposed an integrated framework to explore the targeted conservation strategies of UGS patches. Specifically, the circuit theory model and gravity floating catchment area method were adopted to evaluate ecological connectivity and spatial accessibility of UGS under multiple scenarios in terms of different species dispersal distances and resident travelling modes, and Pareto ranking analysis was utilized to identify conservation priorities of UGS. Wuhan City in central China was taken as a case study. The results show that Wuhan exhibits low synergic relationship of ecological connectivity and spatial accessibility of UGS, and only approximately 7.51% of UGS patches on average rank high. Based on the frequency of UGS Pareto ranks under different scenarios, the differentiated conservation strategy was developed, which identified 10 key green areas that need to be protected and 11 green areas that need to be restored.

Conservation planning in NKEFAs needs to scientifically locate conservation areas and development sites to support the globally conserved, locally developed strategy. However, popular conservation planning approaches often underestimate the impacts of natural and anthropogenic stressors and thus fail to handle the conflicts between conservation and development goals. This article proposes a conservation planning framework (CP-NKEFA) to overcome the limitations of popular conservation planning approaches and fulfill the conservation planning requirements of China's NKEFAs. Conservation planning is converted to an ecological risk assessment problem to integrate natural and anthropogenic stressors analysis with ecosystem service (ES) evaluation. The framework clarifies stressor types and quantifies stressor risks and ES importance to set conservation, development, and buffer zones. As a case study, the framework was implemented in Changyang County, China, an NKEFA for water and soil retention in the Three Gorges Reservoir Region. The framework is more useful than typical ecological redline zoning for instructing conservation and development spatial arrangement with a multi-category zoning scheme. The zoning results protect the areas vulnerable to natural and anthropogenic stressors or significant for ES provisions. Furthermore, the buffer zone prevents direct impacts of human activities on conservation areas and permits trade-offs between conservation and development goals. Except for NKEFAs, the framework also applies to conservation planning in other areas where conservation and development goals must be handled.","[Pan, Fangjie; Wan, Qing] Wuhan Inst Technol, Sch Management, Wuhan 430205, Peoples R China; [Song, Mingjie] Cent China Normal Univ, Coll Publ Adm, Wuhan 430079, Peoples R China; [Yuan, Lanlan] Wuhan Real Estate Registrat Ctr, Wuhan 430015, Peoples R China",smingjie@mail.ccnu.edu.cn,56,0,0,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0167-6369,ENVIRON MONIT ASSESS,Environ.

The results show that: (1) Social trust has a significant positive impact on rural households' conservation attitudes. (2) Males' ecological conservation attitudes are influenced by all the social trust variables, whereas females' attitudes are influenced mainly by interpersonal trust (trust in neighbors and villagers). The conservation attitudes of households with higher education levels and higher family incomes are mainly affected by trust in government, while those with lower education levels and lower family incomes are more significantly affected by the trust in villagers and village cadres.

The research method was focused on a survey study regarding conservation of greenbelts with their significant impacts on environment, commercial market and the business community itself in the City of Peshawar, Pakistan. The study was projected mainly through an adapted questionnaire (n = 200) and then analyzed through Statistical Package for Social Sciences applying chi-square test and cross-tables, graphs, frequencies and percentages. The study highlighted the deterioration of greenbelts' infrastructure system smashed possibly with improper developmental plans inside the urban fringes and inadequate maintenance of green structures. Opinion measures reported improved environmental and psychological paybacks, i.e., development of strong human senses to release stress and purify air, and several other benefits (a healthy, green, noise and pollution-free environment). The percentage swift urban sprawl and commercialization are the main causes of greenbelt deterioration and uplift of urban property costs. On the other hand, lack of spaces for greenbelts is a major cause for non-availability of facilities like sitting areas, walking track, trees, streetlights and car parking area.

Without their connectivity, a very large number of species would not have access to all of the habitats needed for their life cycles. Although the concept of an ecological corridor has been discussed for many years, few studies on ecological corridors for frogs have been conducted. Frogs are often considered to be a keystone species. They are a good indicator of habitat health, and they are often the first to be harmed by pollution or ecosystem deterioration. However, there have been reports of frogs crossing ecological corridors and being attacked or consumed by natural enemies. It is vital to create ecological corridors for frogs that allow them to migrate quickly and safely. The purpose of this study was to propose a new ecological corridor design concept for frogs to address the limitations mentioned above. In this paper, grey system theory was employed to offer the necessary information for the frog ladder's design.

Drawing on the literature documenting this in theory and practice, we present a comprehensive overview of climate change risks and considerations across the whole life cycle of a restoration initiative. The resulting framework identified seven areas of restoration design and implementation in which climate change is important to address: setting restoration objectives, selecting sites and managing connectivity, choosing target species and ecosystems, managing key ecosystem interactions and micro-climates, identifying and mitigating site-level climate change risks, aligning the project with long-term policies, and designing a monitoring framework that enables adaptive management. A scan of restoration projects focussing on two regions - Brazil and countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, ASEAN - revealed limited inclusion of these considerations in practice, with less than 5% of the projects evidently addressing at least one of the seven areas. We discuss two projects showing good practice in climate resilient restoration: restoration of Atlantic forest in Brazil that plans for climate change in connectivity and hydrological management, species selection, and policy alignment, and crayweed underwater forest restoration in Sydney, Australia, whose careful attention to species provenance, genotype measurement and monitoring provided a future-proofing approach to restoration success in the long term.

Low diversity at Astola Island was mainly due to habitat destruction caused by increasing anthropogenic activities (coral mining, careless SCUBA and skin diving, entangling of corals by fishing nets and mechanical damage by deployment of lobster pots). Conservation efforts should focus on the establishment of effective marine protected areas, involvement of different stakeholder (well reputed research institutes, universities, dive centers, tour operators, local community), making tourism laws and their implementation, rehabilitation of microhabitats for fish communities through the involvement of local community and creating awareness in general public on the significance (ecological, commercial) of these natural resources via print and electronic media for a sustainable ecotourism.

The results of the study show that ecological footprints on mineral resources confirmed the hump-shaped relationship between them. The enormous human demand for natural capital is viewed further in the environmental accounting system. Ecological footprints cause a greater extraction of mineral resources that jeopardize future stocks of rare earth's resources. The panel estimates show that insurance and financial services, massive population growth, and continued economic growth decreases mineral resource rents. In contrast, energy efficiency and trade policies increase mineral resource rents across countries. In general, the results support the economic policies that help reduce human demand for natural capital by efficient insurance services, sustainable economic growth, energy efficiency, and trade fair policies.

This study aims to determine (1) the level of environmental awareness and the motivation of farmers to conserve critical lands, (2) the motivation of farmers to adopt conservation techniques, and (3) the effect of environmental awareness on motivation in adopting conservation techniques in three agro-ecological zones, i.e., the highlands, lowlands, and coastal areas. The number of respondents was 600 farmers with an equal number of samples for each zone. The analytical tools used were the crosstab, Spearman correlation, and the structural equation modeling (SEM). The first key finding is that the agro-ecological zone difference determined the level of environmental awareness and farmers' motivation to implement conservation. The second key result is that the coastal area farmers had higher motivations to adopt conservation techniques than the other two agro-ecological zones. We also observe that the farmers who had a high level of environmental awareness will have a strong motivation to adopt conservation techniques.

Redundancy analyses were used to determine the factors contributing (policy, socioeconomic factors, and environmental factors) to HWB and giant panda habitat conservation (HC). In addition, using a structural equation model (SEM), we investigated the relationship between the aforementioned three factors and their direct and indirect effects on HWB and HC. The results indicated that there was spatiotemporal heterogeneity of HWB and HC in our study area. There was an increasing number of plant species as well as an increased number of giant panda in GPNP. Generally, HWB in 2015 showed an increasing trend compared with that in 2000. Socioeconomic factors (23.6%) have the biggest influence on HWB and HC, followed by policy (23.2%) and environmental factors (19.4%). Conservation policy had a significantly positive influence on HWB (0.52), while it negatively influenced HC (-0.15). Socioeconomic factors significantly negatively influenced HWB (-0.38). The formulation and implementation of policies to promote economic development will contribute to the protection of giant pandas and their habitat.

Because the fish are obligate air-breathers, it is possible to use surface-breathing events to count individuals visually for population censuses important for conservation, yet uncertainties remain about body size and environmental influences on air-breathing intervals, and thus count accuracy. This study examined relationships between breathing intervals and environmental parameters (e.g. water temperature and transparency) and body size for radio-tagged arapaima (n = 12) in an upland river-floodplain (Lake Ayapua, Amazonas, Brazil). Generalized additive mixed models were used to evaluate environmental, size, and behavioural correlates of breathing intervals. Temperature was the most influential predictor of air-breathing intervals, followed by body size. The shortest breathing intervals were associated with consecutive 'aggressive' breaths while the longest breathing intervals had consecutive 'calm' breaths. Type of breath, size, and temperature predictors revealed that breathing intervals ranged from 4 to 46 min and were not significantly different among life stages ( x over bar = 15.9 min for sub-adults and adults (>1 m); x over bar = 14.8 min for juveniles (<1 m)). Whereas the current population census method uses fish counts in 20-min intervals, this study found that 15% of observed breaths, and two thirds of fish, took longer than 20 min to breathe. These findings were obtained in relatively cool-water environments, so it is recommended that future population census methods consider water temperature (e.g. extend intervals used for counts in cooler waters), which may improve the accuracy of census counts and thus further enhance arapaima conservation efforts. This study demonstrated an effective method in which fundamental biological information is used to inform and improve population census methods for an imperilled fish in a region where traditional stock assessment is ineffective. Similar approaches for adaptive stock assessments could be applied to improve conservation of other air-breathing fishes (e.g. lungfishes) globally.","[Stokes, Gretchen L.; Castello, Leandro] Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Dept Fish & Wildlife Conservat, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA; [Petersen, Thiago A.] Inst Nacl de Pesquisas da Amazonia, Programa Posgrad Biol Agua Doce & Pesca Interior, Manaus, Amazonas, Brazil; [Cooke, Steven J.] Carleton Univ, Dept Biol, Fish Ecol & Conservat Physiol Lab, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Power, Michael] Univ Waterloo, Dept Biol, Waterloo, ON, Canada; [Zuanon, Jansen] Inst Nacl de Pesquisas da Amazonia, Coordenacao Biodiversidade, Manaus, Amazonas, Brazil; [Martins, Eduardo G.] Univ Northern British Columbia, Ecosyst Sci & Management Program, Prince George, BC, Canada",gstokes@ufl.edu,67,0,0,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1052-7613,AQUAT CONSERV,Aquat.

We characterized their ecological niche using different methods and metrics drawn from niche modelling and by re-examining phylogenetic relationships of a recently published molecular phylogeny of this family to gain a better understanding of its biogeographic and evolutionary history. We assessed both lines of evidence from the perspective of niche conservatism to set a foundation for discussing hypotheses about the processes underlying the distribution and evolution of the group. In fish clades where the species composition is not clear, we examined whether niche classification could be informative to discriminate groups geographically and ecologically consistent with any of the different hypotheses of valid species. The characterization of the ecological niche was carried out using the Maxent algorithm under different parameterizations and the projection of the presence on the main components of the most relevant environmental coverage, and the niche comparison was calculated with two indices (D and I), both in environmental space and in that projected geographically. With the molecular data, a species tree was generated using the *BEAST method. The comparison of these data was calculated with an age-overlap correlation test. Based on the molecular phylogeny and on niche overlap analyses, we uncovered strong evidence to support the idea that ecologically similar species are not necessarily sister species. The correlation analysis for genetic distance and niche overlap was not significant (P > 0.05). In clades with taxonomic conflicts, we only identified Profundulus oaxacae as a geographically and ecologically distinct group from P. punctatus. All the evidence considered leads us to propose that Profundulidae do not show evidence of niche conservatism and that there are reasons to consider P. oaxacae as a valid species. Our study suggests that niche divergence is a driving evolutionary force that caused the diversification and speciation processes of the Profundulidae, along with the geological and climatic events that promoted the expansion or contraction of suitable environments.","[Calixto-Rojas, Miguel; Lira-Noriega, Andres; Pinacho-Pinacho, Carlos D.] Inst Ecol AC, Red Estudios Mol Avanzados, Carretera Antigua Coatepec 351, Xalapa 91070, Veracruz, Mexico; [Rubio-Godoy, Miguel] Inst Ecol AC, Red Biol Evolut, Carretera Antigua Coatepec 351, Xalapa, Veracruz, Mexico; [Perez-Ponce de Leon, Gerardo] Escuela Nacl Estudios Superiores Unidad Merida UN, Ucu, Mexico",csdraco@gmail.com,77,2,2,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-1112,J FISH BIOL,J.

Ecological field studies and management surveys from six sites were combined with a participatory-deliberative appraisal exercise using the Multi-Criteria Mapping (MCM) method. All six study sites and all four land use options in the appraisal were characterised by the use of large herbivores for agricultural and/or conservation purposes, to varying degrees, and were located in South-East England. MCM participants identified habitat and species diversity, soil health, food production, provision of education and recreational access, as the principal benefits associated with successful management of such sites. Taken overall, their appraisals indicated that a combination of land uses may be best suited to delivering these diverse benefits, but with agroecological (While organic and biodynamic agriculture are subject to legal definition, agroecology offers a more flexible approach and can be viewed as 'a development pathway from input-intensive industrial systems through to highly sustainable, ecological systems'-see Laughton, R. (2017) 'A Matter of Scale', Land Workers Alliance and Centre for Agroecology, Coventry University) farming being perceived as a particularly effective multi-purpose option. Five of the six sites were used for recreational purposes, and in total we recorded five times more humans than wild mammals. Ecological data from the sites indicated that the most conservation-oriented sites performed best in terms of species richness and activity (birds, mammals, bats and invertebrates) and number of species of conservation concern. However, beta diversity metrics indicated important variation in the species assemblages recorded within and between sites. Whereas both agroecological farms in our study produced the greatest weight of saleable meat per unit area, the site that produced the most meat also demonstrated consistently strong performance across many biodiversity metrics. Overall, expert perspectives and the performance of our study sites suggests that combinations of diverse approaches to the management of large herbivores, within a 'wildlife-friendly' envelope, are consistent with providing for the diverse needs of people and nature within shared landscapes.

However, it negatively affects ecological land (e.g., forest, grassland, and wetland). Identifying a win-win approach for cropland protection and ecological conservation is important. Land use optimization plays a vital role in solving conflicts among land uses. Thus, in this research, taking China (mainland) as the study area, we optimized the spatial distribution of urban land and cropland to balance the requirement of cropland protection strategies and their negative effects on ecological land according to the spatial heterogeneity of land agricultural production capacity by using the LAND System Cellular Automata model for Potential Effects (LANDSCAPE). Specifically, we developed three optimization scenarios from compensational, occupancy, and occupancy and compensational sectors. We also developed one non-optimization scenario to remain comparable. Results show that compared with the non-optimization scenario, the reduced loss of ecological land in compensational, occupancy, and occupancy and compensational optimization scenario is 7180, 247, and 7277 km(2), respectively. Our research indicates that we should prioritize the quality of compensated cropland when developing cropland protection strategies and planning, considering the low efficiency of the occupancy optimization and the cost of policymaking and implementing.","[Wang, Liye; Liu, Yaolin] Wuhan Univ, Sch Resource & Environm Sci, 129 Luoyu Rd, Wuhan 430079, Peoples R China; [Wang, Liye; Tang, Lanping; Zhang, Siyu; Ke, Xinli] Huazhong Agr Univ, Coll Publ Adm, Wuhan 430070, Peoples R China; [Zheng, Weiwei] Northwest A&F Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Liu, Yaolin] Wuhan Univ, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Geospatial Informat Techno, 129 Luoyu Rd, Wuhan 430079, Peoples R China",yaolin610@163.com; kexl@mail.hzau.edu.cn,61,6,6,ACADEMIC PRESS LTD- ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,LONDON,"24-28 OVAL RD, LONDON NW1 7DX, ENGLAND",0301-4797,J ENVIRON MANAGE,J.

OCBILs have been in existence contemporaneously with rainforest since Gondwanan times. Such landscapes are common in areas of eucalypt species richness embraced by Australia's two Global Biodiversity Hotspots, the Southwest Australian Floristic Region and the Forests of East Australia. Here, I summarize evidence pertaining to the eucalypts in the context of a recent reformulation of OCBIL theory into 12 evolutionary, ecological and cultural hypotheses and ten conservation management hypotheses. A compelling argument emerges for a new interpretation of the eucalypts evolving out of the OCBILs, rather than out of the rainforests as traditionally interpreted. This calls for a significant reinterpretation of best conservation management of the eucalypts. For example, traditional ideas on application of fire in eucalypt communities regarded as well adapted to this disturbance need to give way to a more nuanced and cautious view. This review of eucalypts seen as evolving out of the OCBILs helps in understanding the group from several new perspectives. Interpretation of other sedentary plant and animal groups as out of the OCBILs is commended for further study.","[Hopper, Stephen D.] Univ Western Australia, Ctr Excellence Nat Resource Management, Sch Agr & Environm, 35 Stirling Terrace, Albany, WA 6330, Australia",steve.hopper@uwa.edu.au,172,5,5,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0024-4066,BIOL J LINN SOC,Biol.

The inclusion of Asian elephants in Appendix I of the CMS would provide the species with the international conservation importance, trans-boundary cooperation for conservation of elephants and in providing legal protection to the migratory routes of the elephants across international boundaries.

The limited availability of baseline data on this specific area of research has resulted in an inadequate assessment of the ecological implications of plant and animal species caught and discarded during trawl operation. In this context, an attempt was made to document the marine faunal diversity and biomass of NEB destroyed and discarded by trawl operations along the Thoothukudi coast, Gulf of Mannar Marine Biosphere Reserve (GoMMBR), India. The results of study revealed that percentage composition of different phyla represented in the NEB bycatch during the sampling period are Echinodermata (47.81%), Cnidaria (16.40%), Mollusca (13.34%), Arthropoda (9.94%), Porifera (5.13%), Chordata (0.12%) and Others (7.27%). In total, 16 taxonomic groups were represented where in group-wise assemblage of the biomass was dominated by sea stars (25.61%) followed by sea urchins (16.64%), jellyfishes (16.40%), gastropods (7.80%), stomatopods (6.65%), sponges (5.13%), while other taxonomic groups contributed less than 5% of the total NEB biomass. In terms of species diversity, echinoderms showed the highest number (21 species) followed by molluscs (20 species), arthropods (11 species), cnidarians (6 species), and others form fewer in numbers (<5 species). The seasonal percentage biomass of NEB shows a maximum in the summer, SuM (36.1%) followed by monsoon, MoN (23%) whereas the Bray-Curtis similarity coefficient revealed high similarity (58.58%) in biomass composition between post-monsoon, PoM & pre-monsoon, PrM. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) showed that the extracted principal component 1 (PC1) explained 65.1% of the total seasonal variability in the NEB biomass. Given the worldwide marine biota destruction due to trawl fishing, this report provides baseline information about the magnitude of the ecologically important marine NEBs dislodged and discarded during the bottom trawl fishery.

The aim of this strategy is to manage ecology, environmental challenges, and resource depletion occurring under rapid economic development. However, research has not been conducted to assess the progress of ecological civilization after the implementation of this national strategy across China's provinces and over time, and the comparison in ecological civilization progress before and after the implementation of the national strategy is still unknown. This information is critically important as it can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of the national strategy and provide useful guidelines for future policy-making to better manage national ecology and environment. To address this knowledge gap, we assessed ecological civilization progress across China's provinces in 2012-2017 and 2007-2012. Comprehensive assessments were based on a synthetical weight-based index consisting of 33 indicators that focus on ecosystem conservation, environmental quality improvement, and rational utilization of resource. The results demonstrated that at a national level, the general progress rate of ecological civilization reached 14.94% in 2012-2017, which was 2.3 times of the levels recorded in 2007-2012. Unexpectedly, the growth rate of progress in the most important dimension-ecosystem conservation (7.54%)-was far lower than that of environmental quality improvement (19.46%) and rational utilization of resource progress (17.11%). Moreover, large variations existed among ecological civilization progress across provinces. After the implementation of the ECC strategy, developing provinces made more improvement in ecological civilization progress than developed provinces.

Direct threats to biodiversity within PAs and their interactions with broader-scale threats are both likely to vary with PA spatial and management characteristics (e.g., location, dependence on ecotourism revenues, governmental support). Private Land Conservation Areas (PLCAs) are interesting case study systems for assessing cross-scale threats to PAs and their determinants. Despite the growing number of PLCAs around the world, there is considerable uncertainty regarding the long-term capacity of these privately owned areas to conserve biodiversity. Their potential impermanence is commonly raised as a key concern. To better understand the threats to which different types of PLCAs are likely to be vulnerable, we asked 112 PLCA landholders in South Africa what they perceived as the top threats to their PLCAs. Landowners identified direct threats to the biodiversity within their PLCAs (e.g., poaching, extreme weather, inappropriate fire regimes, alien species) as well as describing broader socio-economic threats (e.g., regional crime, national legislation and politics, global economic recessions), which were noted to interact across scales. We found support for the hypothesis that patterns in the perceived multi-scale threats to a PLCA correspond with its management and spatial characteristics, including its remoteness, dependence on ecotourism or hunting revenues, and richness of megafaunal species. Understanding the threats to which different PLCAs may be vulnerable is useful for developing more nuanced, targeted strategies to build PLCA resilience to these threats (for example, by strengthening the capacity of self-funded PLCAs to cope with the threat of economic downturns through more innovative financial instruments or diversified revenue streams). Our findings highlight the importance of considering interactions between broad-scale socioeconomic changes and direct threats to biodiversity, which can influence the resilience of PAs in ways that are not anticipated by more traditional, discipline-specific consideration of direct threats to the biodiversity within their boundaries.","[Clements, Hayley S.; Biggs, Reinette] Stellenbosch Univ, Ctr Complex Syst Transit, 19 Jonkershoek Rd, ZA-7602 Matieland, South Africa; [Biggs, Reinette] Stockholm Univ, Stockholm Resilience Ctr, SE-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; [Cumming, Graeme S.] James Cook Univ, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Cumming, Graeme S.] Univ Cape Town, DST NRF Ctr Excellence, Percy FitzPatrick Inst, ZA-7701 Cape Town, South Africa",clementshayley@gmail.com,65,3,3,ACADEMIC PRESS LTD- ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,LONDON,"24-28 OVAL RD, LONDON NW1 7DX, ENGLAND",0301-4797,J ENVIRON MANAGE,J.

This study aims to analyse the impact of urbanisation on ecological lands and farmland by comparing respective losses of habitat quality and agricultural productivity potential. Different scenarios are established indicating the priority of conserving ecological lands or farmland based on their vulnerability as measured by weight. With a land-use simulation model LANDSCAPE, the demand for urban land is met by occupying inferior ecological lands or farmland. Land-use patterns in each scenario are projected to 2035 in Wuhan (a rapidly urbanising city in China). As the weight of habitat quality decreases, the loss of habitat quality increases from 2.56 to 5.80%, while the loss of agricultural productivity potential decreases from 4.16 to 2.94%. The higher vulnerability of habitat quality loss indicates that ecological lands need a priori conservation than farmland in exchange for urbanisation.","[Zhou, Ting; Ke, Xinli] Huazhong Agr Univ, Dept Publ Adm, Shizishan Rd 1, Wuhan, Peoples R China",kexl@igsnrr.ac.cn,51,0,0,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0364-152X,ENVIRON MANAGE,Environ.

This study covers a systematic and quantitative assessment of the function, design, and purpose of establishing a regional eco-tourism program using the Sahn-Yang Gotjawal (Volcanic Lava Stony Forest) natural resources of Jeju Island, South Korea. Although citizens' interest in Jeju Gotjawal has increased, reckless exploration and damage still occurred. There were improvements on the movement to preserve geological features and the ecosystem. However, unfortunately the negative effects of only seeking development opportunities without regard to the environment was realized as well. Through strengths, opportunities, aspirations, results (SOAR) analysis, various potential situations and conditions using the Sahn-Yang Gotjawal resources were analyzed with quantitative and qualitative techniques. In addition, through media analysis, the benefits and opportunities that the Gotjawal resources could provide the citizens were identified and the results were combined with SOAR analysis to present an integrated vision. In order to make wise use of Sahn-Yang Gotjawal, such as conserving, sustaining, and creating accessibility (guided by SESs), it is necessary to concentrate on the 'strengths' such as creating and maximizing attractions which can develop management programs such as preservation research and monitoring, as well as establishing sustainable usage of facilities such as visitors' gathering spaces, exploration activities, and convenient facilities.","[Hong, Chang-Yu] Jeju Res Inst, Dept Urban Environm Res, Jeju 63147, South Korea; [Yoon, Ran] Seoul Natl Univ, Sch Environm Planning, Seoul 08826, South Korea; [Hwang, Jung-Don] Jeju Natl Univ, Dept Econ, Jeju 63243, South Korea; [Jwa, Min-Seok] Jeju Res Inst, Dept Future Strategy, Jeju 63147, South Korea",503changyu@gmail.com; ranyoon525@gmail.com; lifeisreal@empas.com; jms69@jri.re.kr,39,0,0,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,2020,gold,

As such, it has a great potential to generalize and synthesize our understanding of many ecological problems. Here, we give an overview of how a metacommunity perspective can provide useful insights for conservation biology, which aims to understand and mitigate the effects of anthropogenic drivers that decrease population sizes, increase extinction probabilities, and threaten biodiversity. We review four general metacommunity processes-environmental filtering, biotic interactions, dispersal, and ecological drift-and discuss how key anthropogenic drivers (e.g., habitat loss and fragmentation, and nonnative species) can alter these processes. We next describe how the patterns of interest in metacommunities (abundance, occupancy, and diversity) map onto issues at the heart of conservation biology, and describe cases where conservation biology benefits by taking a scale-explicit metacommunity perspective.

Cancer is a ubiquitous disease that affects most metazoan species; however, the role of oncogenic phenomena in eco-evolutionary processes and its implications for wildlife management and conservation remains undeveloped. Despite the pervasive nature of cancer across taxa, our ability to detect its occurrence, progression and prevalence in wildlife populations is constrained due to logistic and diagnostic limitations, which suggests that most cancers in the wild are unreported and understudied. Nevertheless, an increasing number of virus-associated and directly transmissible cancers in terrestrial and aquatic environments have been detected. Furthermore, anthropogenic activities and sudden environmental changes are increasingly associated with cancer incidence in wildlife. This highlights the need to upscale surveillance efforts, collection of critical data and developing novel approaches for studying the emergence and evolution of cancers in the wild. Here, we discuss the relevance of malignant cells as important agents of selection and offer a holistic framework to understand the interplay of ecological, epidemiological and evolutionary dynamics of cancer in wildlife. We use a directly transmissible cancer (devil facial tumour disease) as a model system to reveal the potential evolutionary dynamics and broader ecological effects of cancer epidemics in wildlife. We provide further examples of tumour-host interactions and trade-offs that may lead to changes in life histories, and epidemiological and population dynamics. Within this framework, we explore immunological strategies at the individual level as well as transgenerational adaptations at the population level. Then, we highlight the need to integrate multiple disciplines to undertake comparative cancer research at the human-domestic-wildlife interface and their environments. Finally, we suggest strategies for screening cancer incidence in wildlife and discuss how to integrate ecological and evolutionary concepts in the management of current and future cancer epizootics.","[Hamede, Rodrigo; Jones, Menna; Ujvari, Beata] Univ Tasmania, Sch Nat Sci, Private Bag 55, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia; [Hamede, Rodrigo; Dujon, Antoine M.; Ujvari, Beata] Deakin Univ, Ctr Integrat Ecol, Sch Life & Environm Sci, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Owen, Rachel; Siddle, Hannah] Univ Southampton, Ctr Biol Sci, Southampton, Hants, England; [Peck, Sarah] Vet Register Tasmania, South Hobart, Tas, Australia; [Giraudeau, Mathieu; Roche, Benjamin; Thomas, Frederic] Univ Montpellier, Ctr Rech Ecol & Evolut Canc, Ctr Rech Ecol & Evolut Sante, Unite Mixte Rech,Inst Rech Dev 224,Ctr Natl Rech, Montpellier, France",rkhamede@utas.edu.au; sarah.j.peck@utas.edu.au,149,14,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1752-4571,EVOL APPL,Evol.

At least half of the forests present today have grown on formerly cultivated lands, pastures or heathlands. However, net forest expansion largely masks a slow but irretrievable erosion of ancient forests. Meanwhile, forest resource harvesting (biomass, litter) has fundamentally changed during the last two centuries, moving from intensive biomass removal to increased growing stocks in different European countries. This article reviews the current knowledge on the long-term legacies of past land use and forest management practices and their effects on the functions, diversity and composition of understory vegetation of current forest ecosystems. First, we define the concepts of forest continuity and ancient forest. Then, based on the French case, we present the advances in historical sources, which make it possible to better reconstruct the change in land use and forest management practices over the last two hundred years. We review how understory plant communities and their traits respond to forest continuity and to different types of former agricultural uses, both at local and landscape scales. We then address three important issues for conservation and management: the conservation value of ancient forests, the impact of forest management on the ecological integrity of ancient forests, and the under-explored legacies of former forest management practices on soil and understory vegetation. Lastly, we propose five main fronts for future research efforts: (a) explore all types of cartographic, written sources and environmental markers; (b) develop modelling approaches to understand how past land use shapes plant communities; (c) better define the conservation value of ancient forests in conservation and management policies; (d) investigate how drivers of global change interact with forest management and land use legacies and (e) explore land use legacies in mountain and Mediterranean socio-ecological systems.","[Berges, Laurent] Univ Grenoble Alpes, LESSEM, INRAE, F-38402 St Martin Dheres, France; [Dupouey, Jean-Luc] Univ Lorraine, AgroParisTech, INRAE, UMR SILVA, Nancy, France",laurent.berges@inrae.fr,170,14,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1100-9233,J VEG SCI,J.

As important representatives of Chinese traditional agriculture, the agricultural heritage systems on aquatic-ecological conservation (AHSAEC) are confronting threats and urgently needs to be protected. In this study, the functions and value of the AHSAECs are analyzed by multi-disciplinary methods including system analysis methods based on the review of old books and modern scientific research literature, and the nature of their sustainability are discussed, and the countermeasures against their current unsustainability are proposed. The results show that AHSAECs derive from the simple eco-agriculture models such as the Taihu Lake multi-industry compound ecoagriculture model in historical periods. These systems can integrate farming, forestry, animal husbandry, and aquaculture and make them a sustainable recycling system. Thus, they have strong ecological stability, rich cultural connotation, and good comprehensive benefits. Traditional eco-wisdom from Chinese traditional culture is the power to promote the sustainability and high-quality development of these systems. The key eco-wisdom of AHSAECs is to integrate aquaculture with livestock and poultry breeding and planting through the harmless treatment and recycling of agricultural wastes, which is conducive to the aquatic ecosystem conservation and sustainable resources utilization. Nowadays, it is urgent to preserve the eco-wisdom by establishing ecological museums to realize the productive protection and inheriting development of the heritage systems.","[Li, Maolin] Xinyang Agr & Forestry Univ, Coll Forestry, Xinyang 464000, Peoples R China; [Li, Maolin] Third Div Xinjiang Prod & Construct Corps, Bur Ecol & Environm, Tumushuke 844000, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Yongxun] Chinese Acad Agr Sci, Inst Agr Econ & Dev, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Xu, Ming] Minist Agr & Rural Affair, Ctr Int Cooperat Serv, Beijing 100125, Peoples R China; [He, Lulu] China Agr Univ, Coll Humanities & Dev Studies, Beijing 100094, Peoples R China; [Liu, Longteng] Chinese Acad Fishery Sci, Fisheries Dev Strategy Res Ctr, Beijing 100141, Peoples R China; [Tang, Qisheng] Chinese Acad Fishery Sci, Yellow Sea Fisheries Res Inst, Qingdao 266071, Peoples R China",limaolin99@hotmail.com; zhangyongxun@caas.cn; xuming@agri.gov.cn; helulu2013@163.com; liult@cafs.ac.cn; ysfri.chn@gmail.com,34,4,5,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,2020,"Green Published, gold",

Although there has been extensive research on the development of methods and tools for conservation planning, especially spatial planning, comparatively little is known about the relative importance of ecological versus non-ecological data for prioritization, or the likely return on investment of incorporating better data. We demonstrate a simple approach for (1) quantifying the sensitivity of spatial planning results to different ecological and non-ecological data layers, and (2) estimating the potential gains in efficiency from incorporating additional data. Our case study involves spatial planning for coastal squeeze, a process by which development blocks coastal ecosystems from moving landward in response to sea-level rise. We show that incorporating spatial data on landowners' likelihood of selling had little effect on identifying relative priorities but drastically changed the outlook for whether conservation goals could be achieved. Better data on the costs of conservation actions had the greatest potential to improve the efficiency of spatial planning, in some cases generating more than an order of magnitude greater cost savings compared to ecological data. Our framework could be applied to other systems to guide the development of spatial planning and to identify general rules of thumb for the importance of alternative data sources for conservation problems in different socio-ecological contexts.","[Field, Christopher R.] Univ Maryland, Natl Socioenvironm Synth Ctr SESYNC, 1 Pk Pl, Annapolis, MD 21401 USA; [Elphick, Chris S.] Univ Connecticut, Dept Ecol Evolutionary Biol, Ctr Biol Risk, 75 North Eagleville Rd,U-43, Storrs, CT 06269 USA",christopher.field@uconn.edu; chris.elphick@uconn.edu,37,3,3,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"TEMPLE CIRCUS, TEMPLE WAY, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1748-9326,ENVIRON RES LETT,Environ.

The interest to estimate biodiversity increased during the last decades at landscape level. The objective was to elaborate a map of potential biodiversity (MPB) of understory species of Nothofagus forest using potential habitat suitability maps (PHS) of 15 plants in Santa Cruz province, Argentina. Additionally, we asked the following questions: (i) Were plant species differentially distributed according to the forest types?, (ii) do forest types represent different plant species assemblage with specific ecological niche requirements?, and (iii) is it possible to detect hotspots in the MBP according to the forest types? We used 721 plots database of vascular plants. from where 15 indicator species were identified. The assemblage species for different forests (Nothofagus antarctica. N. pumilio and evergreen mixed) were analysed using a detrended correspondence analysis. Also, we explored 41 potential explanatory variables to develop PHS, and combined these maps to obtain one MPB (1-100%). Finally, we analysed the outputs into a GIS through different landscapes alternatives to detect hotspot areas. Marginality and specialization values allowed identifying species assemblage that presented similar variability in the habitat requirements. MPB varied across the landscape, with higher values in the south and lower values near glaciers. MPB had the highest values in N. antarctica forest with >50% cover at landscape level. N. antarctica present more hotspots than N. pumilio forests, mainly in the south, compared evergreen forests which present few hotspots near glaciers.

Special Areas of Conservation (SACs) have been created in European waters under the Habitats Directive to protect bottlenose dolphins, Tursiops truncatus, which forms two ecotypes, pelagic and coastal. The SACs have been designated in coastal waters based on photo-identification studies that have indicated that bottlenose dolphins have relatively high site fidelity. However, individuals can carry out long-distance movements, which suggests potential for demographic connectivity between the SACs as well as with other areas. Connectivity can be studied using genetic markers. Previous studies on the species in this area used different sets of genetic markers and therefore inference on the fine-scale population structure and demographic connectivity has not yet been made at a large scale. A common set of microsatellite markers was used in this study to provide the first comprehensive estimate of genetic structure of bottlenose dolphins in European Atlantic waters. As in previous studies, a high level of genetic differentiation was found between coastal and pelagic populations. Genetic structure was defined at an unprecedented fine-scale level for coastal dolphins, leading to identification of five distinct coastal populations inhabiting the following areas: Shannon estuary, west coast of Ireland, English Channel, coastal Galicia, east coast of Scotland and Wales/west Scotland. Demographic connectivity was very low among most populations with <10% migration rate, suggesting no demographic coupling among them. Each local population should therefore be monitored separately. The results of this study have the potential to be used to identify management units for bottlenose dolphins in this region and thus offer a significant contribution to the conservation of the species in European Atlantic waters. Future studies should prioritize obtaining biopsies from free-living dolphins from areas where only samples from stranded animals were available, i.e. Wales, west Scotland and Galicia, in order to reduce uncertainty caused by sample origin doubt, as well as from areas not included in this study (e.g. Iroise Sea, France). Furthermore, future management strategies should include monitoring local population dynamics and could also consider other options, such as population viability analysis or the incorporation of genetic data with ecological data (e.g. stable isotope analysis) in the designation of management units.","[Nykanen, Milaja; Dillane, Eileen; Rogan, Emer] Univ Coll Cork, Sch Biol Earth & Environm Sci, Cork, Ireland; [Louis, Marie; Gaggiotti, Oscar E.] Scottish Oceans Inst, Gatty Marine Lab, St Andrews KY16 8LB, Fife, Scotland; [Louis, Marie] Univ St Andrews, Scottish Oceans Inst, Sea Mammal Res Unit, Gatty Marine Lab, St Andrews KY16 8LB, Fife, Scotland; [Louis, Marie; Simon-Bouhet, Benoit] Univ La Rochelle, Ctr Etud Biol Chize, UMR 7372, La Rochelle, France; [Alfonsi, Eric] Oceanopolis, Brest, France; [Alfonsi, Eric] Univ Brest, BioGeMME, UFR Sci & Tech, Brest, France; [Berrow, Simon; O'Brien, Joanne] Irish Whale & Dolphin Grp, Kilrush, Clare, Ireland; [Berrow, Simon; O'Brien, Joanne; Mirimin, Luca] Galway Mayo Inst Technol, Sch Sci & Comp, Dept Nat Sci, Marine & Freshwater Res Ctr, Dublin Rd, Galway H91 T8NW, Ireland; [Brownlow, Andrew] SAC Wildlife Unit, Inverness, Scotland; [Covelo, Pablo] CEMMA Coordinadora Estudo Mamiferos Marinos, Gondomar, Spain; [Dabin, Willy] Univ La Rochelle, CNRS, UMS 3462, Observ PELAGIS, La Rochelle, France; [Deaville, Rob] Zool Soc London, Inst Zool, London, England; [de Stephanis, Renaud] Estn Biol Donana CSIC, Dept Conservat Biol, Seville, Spain; [de Stephanis, Renaud; Gauffier, Pauline] CIRCE Conservat Informat & Res Cetaceans, Pelayo, Spain; [Gally, Francois] GECC, Octeville, France; [Ingram, Simon N.] Plymouth Univ, Sch Marine Sci & Engn, Plymouth PL4 8AA, Devon, England; [Lucas, Tamara] Univ La Rochelle, CNRS, UMR 7266, LIENSs Littoral Environm & Soc, La Rochelle, France; [Penrose, Rod] Marine Environm Monitoring, Cardigan, Wales; [Silva, Monica A.] Univ Azores, Ctr Inst Marine Res IMAR, Horta, Azores, Portugal; [Silva, Monica A.] Univ Azores, Dept Oceanog & Fisheries, Horta, Azores, Portugal; [Silva, Monica A.] Lab Robot & Syst Engn & Sci LARSyS, Lisbon, Portugal; [Silva, Monica A.] Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Biol Dept, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA",milaja.ny@gmail.com; marielouis17@hotmail.com,84,7,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1052-7613,AQUAT CONSERV,Aquat.

Knowledge of species distribution, habitat requirements, reproduction, ecology, and population characteristics is limited in the literature. In this study, habitat characteristics, population counts, fruit and seed diversity, and germination were studied for the first time. The results indicate that the species geographical distribution is very restricted, lying in the Mediterranean floristic zone at a low altitude (100-200 m asl) and on very shallow soils. The habitat of this species is characterized by the Csa climate type, with a mean annual precipitation of 602 mm and a mean annual temperature of 14.6 degrees C. The species occurs in the area lying between the geographical coordinates 40 degrees 58 ' 16.59 '' N, 24 degrees 27 ' 54.93 E, and 41 degrees 05 ' 7.2 '' N, 24 degrees 47 ' 17.2 '' E. The species thrives in degraded shrub communities, dominated by the shrub species Paliurus spina-cristi Mill., Olea europea L. ssp. europaea, and Quercus coccifera L. Only a very small number of individuals were found (less than 200) at a density considered too small for long-term persistence of the species. The fruits of the species contained a high number (mean value 58.2) of minute seeds. The seeds exhibited high germination (up to 80.0% in laboratory and up to 30% in ambient conditions). We conclude that in situ and ex situ species conservation and habitat restoration are feasible through the introduction of seedlings produced from seeds collected from local populations.","[Ganatsas, Petros; Tsakaldimi, Marianthi; Damianidis, Christos; Kalapothareas, Theodoros; Karydopoulos, Theodoros] Aristotle Univ Thessaloniki, Dept Forestry & Nat Environm, Lab Silviculture, POB 262,Univ Campus, GR-54124 Thessaloniki, Greece; [Stefanaki, Anastasia] Nat Biodivers Ctr, NL-2332 AA Leiden, Netherlands; [Papapavlou, Kelly] EXERGIA SA, Voukourestiou 15, GR-10672 Athens, Greece",pgana@for.auth.gr; marian@for.auth.gr; cdamiani@for.auth.gr; anastasia.stefanaki@gmail.com; theodorekal@gmail.com; tkarydop@for.auth.gr; kpapapavlou@ath.forthnet.gr,36,8,8,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",2071-1050,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,2019,"gold, Green Submitted",

In social-ecological systems based on traditional rural activities and associated with protected areas, this balance is particularly complex. Quantifying the economic impact of land use changes on ecosystem services can be useful to advise policy makers and improving social-ecological sustainability. In this study, we evaluated the land use changes in a time series and estimated the monetary value of the ecosystem services of the Urdaibai Biosphere Reserve (Biscay, Spain). In addition, we linked the monetary and biophysical values of land uses in each zoning units of the reserve, in order to identify the spatial adjustment between both assessments. Results showed that land use changes have clearly homogenized the landscape without substantially affecting its economic value. The methodological approach allowed detection that the reserve zoning was performed based more on its biophysical values than on economic ones. Thus, evident divergences between the biophysical and economic assessments were found. The core area was the one that had the highest coincidences (medium values) between both ecosystem services assessments, which highlights its importance not only in biophysical terms, is also economical. The procedure followed proved to be a useful tool to social-ecological planning and design of specific conservation strategies for the sustainable development of the area.","[Castillo-Eguskitza, Nekane; Onaindia, Miren] Univ Basque Country, UPV EHU, Plant Biol & Ecol Dept, Biscay 48940, Spain; [Schmitz, Maria F.; Rescia, Alejandro J.] Univ Complutense Madrid, Dept Biodivers Ecol & Evolut, Madrid 28040, Spain",nekane.castillo@ehu.eus; ma296@bio.ucm.es; miren.onaindia@ehu.eus; alejo296@bio.ucm.es,125,4,4,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,2019,"Green Accepted, Green Published, gold",

In this study, we examine the interplay between environmental niche divergence and conservatism in the context of adaptive radiation on oceanic islands, by characterizing the niche breadth of four Hawaiian arthropod radiations: Tetragnatha spiders (Tetragnathidae Latreille, 1804), Laupala crickets (Gryllidae Otte, 1994), a clade of Drosophila flies (Drosophilidae Fallen, 1823) and Nesosydne planthoppers (Delphacidae Kirkaldy, 1907). We assembled occurrence datasets for the four lineages, modelled their distributions and quantified niche overlap. All four groups occupy the islands in distinct ways, highlighting the contrasting axes of diversification for different lineages. Laupala and Nesosydne have opposite environmental niche extents (broad and narrow, respectively), whereas Tetragnatha and Drosophila share relatively intermediate tolerances. Temperature constrains the distributions of all four radiations. Tests of phylogenetic signal suggest that, for Tetragnatha and Drosophila, closely related species exhibit similar environmental niches; thus, diversification is associated with niche conservatism. Sister species comparisons also show that populations often retain similar environmental tolerances, although exceptions do occur. Results imply that diversification does not occur through ecological speciation; instead, adaptive radiation occurs largely within a single environment.","[Hiller, Anna E.; Goodman, Kari R.; O'Grady, Patrick M.; Gillespie, Rosemary G.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Environm Sci Policy & Management, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Koo, Michelle S.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Museum Vertebrate Zool, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Shaw, Kerry L.] Cornell Univ, Dept Neurobiol & Behav, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [O'Grady, Patrick M.] Cornell Univ, Dept Entomol, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Hiller, Anna E.] Louisiana State Univ, Museum Nat Sci, Baton Rouge, LA 70802 USA; [Hiller, Anna E.] Louisiana State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Baton Rouge, LA 70802 USA",ahille2@lsu.edu; gillespie@berkeley.edu,63,5,5,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0024-4066,BIOL J LINN SOC,Biol.

Morphological assessments, dietary analyses, and genetic data altogether suggest the dolphins found in Taiwanese and Japanese waters are from the same population, which exhibits high genetic diversity and a sign of recent demographic expansion. The dolphin species is endorsed a Rare and Valuable Species (Class II) status and is protected by the Wildlife Conservation Act in Taiwan. However, it is still vulnerable to human activities, in terms of whale-watching tourism and coastal gill-net fisheries, with a growing concern on the level of heavy metal residues found in dolphin tissues.

Conservation interventions to address this conflict are inadequately guided by ecological theory, and instead rely on pragmatic experiential decisions. I review four families of theoretical models that can accommodate essential features of this human-wildlife conflict, namely - prey-refuge, specialist/generalist predation, social-ecological, and metapopulation models. I evaluate their relevance for conservation and arrange each model's predictions along two conceptual dimensions: coexistence and stability. These models are described with examples of pastoralists and snow leopards in the Himalayas, but they can have broader relevance to other regions. All models suggest that livestock-loss can be better controlled in highly productive habitats, than under low productivity. But, they differ in the ease with which their predictions may be translated into real-world conservation interventions. These constraints can be circumvented through animal movement between patches which is represented only in metapopulation models. But. metapopulation models do not offer much clarity on the size of the predator population. Instead, they can prescribe rotational-grazing policies for livestock - another pragmatic management concern. This comparison of models identifies lacunae where ecological theory could be better integrated within conservation practice. One option is better integration with emerging knowledge of animal movement. Comparative analyses of models helps identify future directions where outcomes of alternative management interventions can be predicted and evaluated. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Surprisingly, no binding regulations support global strategies for SWE conservation. This work consists of a literature review performed for the period 2004-2018 to assess the ecological and conservation value of SWEs and the contribution of the Water Framework Directive (WFD) in promoting their conservation. Outcomes from this work open new perspectives on SWEs, which emerge as valuable ecosystems, and confirm their pivotal contribution to watershed biodiversity, resilience, and functionality. Results also suggest clear narrative trends and large knowledge gaps across geographical areas, biological components, and target issues. Additionally, we note that SWEs are under-represented in the frame of WFD implementation, stressing their marginality into assessing procedures. All of this calls for further studies, especially outside Europe and with a global, multi-taxon perspective.

However, the predominantly non-forest ecosystems of Brazil have no specific legislation protecting their ecological particularities. Many authors have emphasized the relevance of recognizing the ecological importance of non-forest ecosystems and the need to include them in conservation priorities. Southern Brazil, northeastern Argentina and Uruguay harbor one of the most fascinating ecosystems of the southern South American grasslands, the Butia palm groves. These are natural non-forest ecosystems dominated by populations of Butia species (Arecaceae) scattered through the grassy matrix. Land conversion to agriculture, silviculture and urban sprawl are the greatest threats to these palm species. For instance, in the southern Brazilian Pampa grasslands where palm groves were once very abundant, 26% of the natural grasslands have been lost over a period of 30 years. This significant habitat loss is aggravated by the protection of only 0.4 per cent of the Pampa biome within legally designated areas. Furthermore, palm groves are not recognized in Brazilian official vegetation classification systems. Therefore, there is a need to recognize non-forest ecosystems as ecologically integral entities. This implies the necessity of understanding, for instance, that preservation of palm groves is critical to re-establish the natural processes of these ecosystems, i.e., to begin to support the natural renewal process of palm groves, jointly with conserving the natural grassy matrix and all its diverse flora and fauna. Public policies focusing on these ecosystems and species must include promotion of sustainable use of their products, using their economic value to increase interest in their conservation. Practices that ensure the renewal of populations, such as conservative grazing management and ecosystem restoration, also need to be implemented.","[Sosinski, Enio Egon, Jr.; Barbieri, Rosa Lia; Marchi, Marene Machado] Embrapa Clima Temperado, Pelotas, RS, Brazil; [Urruth, Leonardo Marques; Martens, Silvano Gildo] Secretaria Ambiente & Desenvolvimento Sustentavel, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil",enio.sosinski@embrapa.br,71,3,5,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0264-8377,LAND USE POLICY,Land Use Pol.,2019,,

Water flow within the rivers of the Sundarbans mangrove forest and seasonal variation of water salinity of the rivers were discussed. Highest salinity (electrical conductivity) 27,500 micromhos/cm (Polyhaline zone) and 5800 micromhos/cm (Oligohaline zone) was observed in April; and lowest salinity was 10,150 micromhos/cm (Polyhaline zone, July) and 500 micromhos/cm (Oligohaline zone, July). Environmental constraints and ecophysiological response in relation to soil environment and plant and plant roots in relation to salinity were highlighted. Surface soil of this halophytic forest is silty clay loam; soil pH ranges from 6.9 to 7.5; calcium is the dominant cation and is highest in the Oligohaline zone followed by Mesohaline and Polyhaline zones. The respiratory roots (pneumatophores) of various forms (such as peg like, knee root, buttress roots, stilt roots) in different species were described. Measurement of redox potential in soils from selected places showed low values particularly in the Oligohaline zone (+60 mV, where the Heritiera fomes plant shows top dying) followed by Mesohaline and Polyhaline zone. Low oxidation-reduction potentials (anaerobiosis) may be one of the factors responsible for the cause of top dying, and these properties influence plant growth and distribution. Highest soil salinity (6950 micromhos/cm) was in the Polyhaline zone, and in the Oligohaline zone, highest salinity was 650 micromhos/cm. The vegetation pattern is given based on field observation, with the dominant species; and associated species are placed in relation to density and abundance. Comparison of species composition (large and small trees, shrubs, herbs, palms, fern, lichen and climbers) and their condition in the three ecological zones showed the nature of their distribution pattern. Plant association and distribution of halophyte species in relation to salinity in different ecological zones indicated their nature of distribution.

Nonetheless, it is debatable whether the presence of the pastoralists and livestock in Miombo woodlands is linked to the ecological degradation and resources use conflicts. Besides, the impact of Miombo woodlands utilization in relation to biodiversity and ecosystem service provision is not well understood. The current review describes the various concurrent issues underlying livestock production in Miombo woodlands and ecosystem resilience. Analytical review established that livestock in Miombo woodlands have a crucial role in enhancing food security and animal source protein requirement in the future. Ecologically, pastoralists' presence in the Miombo serves biodiversity conservation, enhances nutrient recycling, and regulates wildfires. On the other hand, pastoralists are faced with several challenges including pests and diseases and persistent drought that leads to scarcity of water and pasture resources. Other setbacks include high enteric methane emission due to poor livestock productivity, unsustainable rangeland management practices, land tenure, and poor water management. Observations of wildlife interactions with the natural ecosystem elsewhere provide crucial evidence for the potential of livestock-woodland beneficial symbiotic interaction. It is concluded that, since there is high ecological compatibility of livestock production in Miombo woodlands, there is need to reform management policy to promote livestock interaction on the Miombo woodlands.","[Ruvuga, Peter Rogers] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Anim Nutr & Management, Uppsala, Sweden; [Ruvuga, Peter Rogers] Univ Dar Es Salaam, Inst Resource Assessment, Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania; [Selemani, Ismail Said; Sangeda, Anthony Zozimus] Sokoine Univ Agr, Dept Anim Aquaculture & Range Sci, Morogoro, Tanzania",peter.ruvuga@slu.se; sangeda@sua.ac.tz,105,0,0,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1610-2010,CLIM CHANG MANAG,,2019,,

Decision makers often hope that ecosystems can be protected by focusing on certain key indicators, which requires an understanding of the relationships between the indicators. Using individual case studies, many have argued that these indicators commonly have significant relationships. However, these relationships at different spatial scales are unclear. Therefore, in this study, biodiversity and ecosystem services are modelled by the ecological niche model, the universal soil loss equation, and the equation of water balance in two study areas at different scales. The influence of vegetation productivity on the spatial pattern of other ecological indicators in the two areas is examined by a spatial lag model. The contributions of the driving factors on biodiversity distribution at both scales are identified by a boosted regression tree (BRT) model. The results showed that at the fine scale, the spatial correlations were strongest for species richness, especially mammalian species richness, and water retention. However, biodiversity had no significant relationship with vegetation productivity. In contrast, at a coarser scale, the correlation was stronger between plant diversity and regulating ecosystem services. In addition, plant diversity was significantly correlated with vegetation productivity. These differences between scales were controlled by various explanatory variables. At the fine scale, biophysical and climatic factors had the strongest effects on biodiversity distribution, while Net Primary Productivity (NPP) and ecoregion also had relatively high influences on biodiversity at the coarse scale. This demonstrates the critical importance of spatial scale in selecting conservation indicators. We suggest that rare mammalian species richness or flagship mammal species are suitable as conservation surrogates in fine-scale conservation planning. However, at a coarser scale, selecting vegetation patches with more rare plant species and high productivity for each ecoregion is a workable alternative method for conservation planning.","[Zhang, Lu; Ouyang, Zhiyun] Chinese Acad Sci, Res Ctr Ecoenvironm Sci, State Key Lab Urban & Reg Ecol, Beijing 100085, Peoples R China",luzhang@rcees.ac.cn; zyouyang@rcees.ac.cn,41,6,6,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,FORESTS,Forests,2019,gold,

Hedgerows play a key role in preserving biocultural diversity and associated ecosystem services. Despite their benefits, in some European regions inappropriate hedge management has led to a drastic degradation of hedgerows, with significant effects on natural and biocultural diversity, landscape connectivity and sustainable flow of ecosystem services. In Central Spain, an ancient hedgerow landscape constitutes a valuable natural and cultural heritage recognized by the establishment of different protection categories. We quantify the main tendency of change of this landscape over time, detecting a process of rural social-ecological decoupling both inside and outside protected areas. The hedgerow network has progressively been degraded and destructured together with the decline and local extinction of woody species, all of them of traditional use and some recorded in red lists for species conservation. This reveals weaknesses in the design and management plans of protected areas that should be effective in conserving the heritage of cultural landscapes and their valuable biocultural diversity and provision of ecosystem services. There is a need to elaborate regulations for the protection of hedgerow landscapes in the Spanish legislation, based on social-ecological relationships. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

However, Atlantic salmon stocked juveniles show higher mortality rates than wild ones when introduced into nature. Hatchery environment, which greatly differs from the natural environment, is identified as the main driver of the phenotypic mismatch between captive and wild parrs. The latter is also suspected to impact the gut microbiota composition, which can be associated with essential metabolic functions for their host. We hypothesized that hatchery-raised parrs potentially recruit gut microbial communities that are different from those recruited in the wild. This study evaluated the impacts of artificial rearing on gut microbiota composition in 0+ parrs meant for stocking in two distinct Canadian rivers: Rimouski and Malbaie (Quebec, Canada). Striking differences between hatchery and wild-born parrs' gut microbiota suggest that microbiota could be another factor that could impact their survival in the targeted river, because the microbiome is narrowly related to host physiology. For instance, major commensals belonging to Enterobacteriaceae and Clostridiacea from wild parrs' gut microbiota were substituted in captive parrs by lactic acid bacteria from the Lactobacillaceae family. Overall, captive parrs host a generalist bacterial community whereas wild parrs' microbiota is much more specialized. This is the very first study demonstrating extensive impact of captive rearing on intestinal microbiota composition in Atlantic salmon intended for wild population stocking. Our results strongly suggest the need to implement microbial ecology concepts into conservation management of endangered salmon stocks supplemented with hatchery-reared parrs.","[Lavoie, Camille; Derome, Nicolas] Laval Univ, Biol Dept, Quebec City, PQ, Canada; [Lavoie, Camille; Derome, Nicolas] Laval Univ, IBIS, Quebec City, PQ, Canada; [Courcelle, Maxime] Montpellier Univ, Inst Sci Evolut ISEM, Montpellier, France; [Redivo, Baptise] Univ Namur, Namur, Belgium",camille.lavoie.7@ulaval.ca,71,20,21,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1752-4571,EVOL APPL,Evol.

However, many shallow lakes have experienced declines in macrophyte vegetation in recent decades, principally due to eutrophication. As changes in macrophyte composition and abundance can affect overall ecological structure and function of a lake, an assessment of the timing and nature of such changes is crucial to our understanding of the wider lake ecosystem. In the typical absence of historical plant records, the macro-remains of macrophytes preserved in lake sediments can be used to assess long-term changes in aquatic vegetation. We generated recent (150-200 years) plant macrofossil records for six English lakes subject to conservation protection to define past macrophyte communities, assess trajectories of ecological change and consider the implications of our findings for conservation targets and strategies. The data for all six lakes reveal a diverse submerged macrophyte community, with charophytes as a key component, in the early part of the sedimentary records. The stratigraphies indicate considerable change to the aquatic vegetation over the last two centuries with a general shift towards species more typically associated with eutrophic conditions. A common feature is the decline in abundance of low-growing charophytes and an increase in tall canopy-forming angiosperms such as fine-leaved Potamogeton species, Zannichellia palustris and Callitriche species. We hypothesise, based on findings from long-term datasets and palaeoecological records from enriched shallow lakes where plants are now absent, that the observed shifts provide a warning to managers that the lakes are on a pathway to complete macrophyte loss such that nutrient load reduction is urgently needed. It is the sound understanding of present-day plant ecology that affords such reliable interpretation of the fossil data which, in turn, provide valuable context for current conservation decisions.","[Bennion, Helen; Sayer, Carl D.; Rose, Neil L.; Goldsmith, Ben; Rawcliffe, Ruth; Burgess, Amy; Clarke, Gina; Turner, Simon] UCL, Dept Geog, Environm Change Res Ctr, Gower St, London WC1E 6BT, England; [Clarke, Stewart J.] Natl Trust, Bury St Edmunds IP33 3WD, Suffolk, England; [Davidson, Thomas A.] Aarhus Univ, Dept Biosci, Vejlsovej 25, DK-8600 Silkeborg, Denmark; [Davidson, Thomas A.] Aarhus Univ, Arctic Res Ctr ARC, Vejlsovej 25, DK-8600 Silkeborg, Denmark; [Wiik, Emma] Univ Regina, Dept Biol, Regina, SK, Canada",h.bennion@ucl.ac.uk; c.sayer@ucl.ac.uk; stewart.clarke@nationaltrust.org.uk; td@bios.au.dk; n.rose@ucl.ac.uk; b.goldsmith@ucl.ac.uk; ruth.rawcliffe@googlemail.com; amy.burgess@ucl.ac.uk; gina.clarke@ucl.ac.uk; simon.turner@ucl.ac.uk; Eme.wiik@gmail.com,85,10,11,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-2728,J PALEOLIMNOL,J.

For both nuclear and mitochondrial markers we found that S. hammondii consists of two genetically distinct, allopatric clusters divided by the Transverse Ranges. To corroborate the northern and southern genetic clusters as conservation units from an ecological perspective, we applied a niche identity test to environmental niche models of the two groups. We found that the niche models of the northern and southern clusters were significantly different, suggesting they may be ecologically non-exchangeable. Given our demonstration of significant genetic and ecological differentiation between allopatric clusters of S. hammondii, we recommend that ongoing conservation efforts consider each as a separate unit with potentially unique management needs.","[Neal, Kevin M.; Shaffer, H.

Scientists and practitioners need to select or avoid areas at greatest risk for species protection, i.e., acting in a proactive or a reactive manner. This proactive/reactive dichotomy takes a particular formulation under the likely changes in climate. Selecting for low-risk areas (usually referred to as climate refugia) is supposed to protect more species with a greater guarantee of their long-term persistence. As a consequence, populations at greatest risk are left unprotected and probably committed to extinction. On the other hand, managing species in high-risk areas is more expensive than setting aside areas of climate refugia and encompasses a set of uncertainties, which makes highly-threatened species more costly and difficult to save. Here, we combine ecological niche models and metrics of climate change to develop spatial conservation schemes for mammals in the Brazilian Amazon. These schemes efficiently identify networks of high-risk and refugia priority areas within species current and future distributions, while complementing the protection already achieved by the Amazon's network of protected areas (PAs). We found that, on average, 25% of mammal distribution is already represented in the established network of PAs. Also, 26% of high-risk and 17% of refugia priority areas overlap with indigenous lands. In addition, species distributions were found mostly in high-risk, compared to in refugia priority areas. We highlight that the strategy to be employed does not necessarily should be binary and a mix of both strategies would guarantee the protection of a larger number of species.","[Ribeiro, Bruno R.; Sales, Lilian P.; Loyola, Rafael] Univ Fed Goias, Dept Ecol, Lab Biogeog Conservacao, Goiania, Go, Brazil; [Ribeiro, Bruno R.; Sales, Lilian P.] Univ Fed Goias, Programa Posgrad Ecol & Evolucao, Ave Esperanca S-N,Campus Samambaia, BR-74690900 Goiania, Go, Brazil; [Loyola, Rafael] Inst Nacl Pesquisas Espaciais, Brazilian Res Network Climate Change Rede Clima, Sao Jose Dos Campos, SP, Brazil",ribeiro.brr@gmail.com,74,20,20,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0960-3115,BIODIVERS CONSERV,Biodivers.

Focusing on the stark differences between German and British approaches to the topic, the article shows how the way these categories were related to each other was a product of the involved practices shaping the experience of the natural environment. As a result of different practices, moral justifications in Britain were one form of argument among many others formulated by conservationists. The logic of discourse was cumulative, comprising of different arguments that were presented as compatible with each other. In Germany, by contrast, conservationists recognized the existence of a variety of arguments for conservation, yet emphasized the incommensurability of these arguments and commonly advanced only one argument as a valid justification. Taking the centrality of the experience of nature into account, the article argues for the expansion of the classical sociology of morality into an ecology of mind.","[Bargheer, Stefan] UCLA, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA",bargheer@soc.ucla.edu,73,0,0,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0003-9756,ARCH EUR SOCIOL,Arch.

Coefficients of conservatism (C values) were developed as indicators of a species' sensitivity to anthropogenic disturbance, and these values are used in Floristic Quality Assessment as a means of assessing natural areas and ecological restoration. However, assigning of these values is subjective and improved quantitative validation of C values is needed. We tested whether there are consistent differences in life histories between species with high and low C values. To do this, we grew 54 species of tallgrass prairie plants in a greenhouse and measured traits that are associated with trade-offs on the fast-slow continuum of life-history strategies. We also grew plants with and without mycorrhizal fungi as a test of these species' reliance on this mutualism. We compared these traits and mycorrhizal responsiveness to C values. We found that six of the nine traits we measured were correlated with C values, and together, traits predicted up to 50 % of the variation in C values. Traits including fast growth rates and greater investment in reproduction were associated with lower C values, and slow growth rates, long-lived leaves and high root: shoot ratios were associated with higher C values. Additionally, plants with high C values and a slow life history were more responsive to mutualisms with mycorrhizal fungi. Overall, our results connect C values with life-history trade-offs, indicating that high C value species tend to share a suite of traits associated with a slow life history.","[Bauer, Jonathan T.] Indiana Univ, Dept Biol, 1001 E 3rd St, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Koziol, Liz; Bever, James D.] Kansas Biol Survey, 2101 Constant Ave, Lawrence, KS 66047 USA; [Bever, James D.] Univ Kansas, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, 1200 Sunnyside Ave, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA",jonathantbauer@gmail.com,49,31,32,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",2041-2851,AOB PLANTS,Aob Plants,2018,"Green Published, Green Submitted, gold",

However, grassland degradation is still severe, and conditions have not been restored as intended. This paper aims to empirically examine the effectiveness of these programs for protecting the grassland condition in the extensive pastoral areas of China. We focus on one major program that has been implemented widely on the grasslands, the Subsidy and Incentive System for Grassland Conservation (SISGC). The normalized difference vegetation index, measured with remote sensing technology, is used to quantify the grassland condition between 2001 and 2014. With data from 54 counties in the pastoral areas of Inner Mongolia, we estimate the impact of SISGC on the grassland condition. A fixed effects model is employed to control for livestock production, climate, time trends, and time-invariant heterogeneity between counties. The model results provide quantitative evidence that the condition of the grasslands has improved significantly because of SISGC; but that the effectiveness of SISGC was offset to some extent by other socio-economic and climate factors, such as increased producer prices and high temperature. This may explain why the actual grassland degradation has not been prevented as effectively as was expected. In addition, the impact of SISGC was stronger in counties with worse initial grassland condition. Furthermore, the effects of producer prices and climate changes were also more pronounced in these counties.

This paper presents a first attempt to provide a prototype framework that can assess ecological vulnerability and evaluate potential impacts of natural, social, economic, environmental pollution, and human health elements on ecological vulnerability with integrating spatial analysis of Geographic Information System (GIS) method and multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA). A general ecological vulnerability index was constructed to describe the vulnerability status in an ecological hot spot of China. The assessment results of this study confirm the poor ecological vulnerability in China that only 1.32% of the China's population lives in not vulnerable ecosystem. A very high percentage (98.68%) of Chinese with 1.34 billion people lives in vulnerable and highly vulnerable area. This situation is mainly caused by increasing population pressure, exhausted nature resources, extensive economic growth, severe environmental pollution, insufficient environmental protection investment, and accelerating population aging. The spatial comparison indicates that spatial disparity existed in China with the central and northwestern provinces showing higher ecological vulnerability than the northeastern and southern provinces. The results of ecological vulnerability assessment can support effective guidance for mid- or long-term ecologic management. The developed framework can be replicated at different spatial and temporal scales using context-specific datasets to support ecological managers and government with decision-making. With available robust climate change models, future research might incorporate climate change into the ecological vulnerability framework. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Even though the most cranes of the latter move shortly between their breeding and wintering grounds, a few of the pairs occasionally maintain their same territories year-round. The classic nesting habitat for G. japonensis is an open wetland consisting of reed dominant vegetation. Recently, however, they have shown a tendency for nesting in the thick alder forests, accounting for over 10% of all nesting pairs in 2009. This shift in habitat selection is one of the factors supporting their recent population growth. During the coldest season, cranes concentrate at a few major artificial feeding stations and then roost in neighboring unfrozen rivers. In recent years, however, individuals feeding at minor stations are increasing because the major feeding stations and roosts are probably reaching their capacity limits. The Hokkaido population is continuously growing since the mid-twentieth century, and numbers of cranes exceeded 1500 as of January 2014. Expansion of G. japonensis distribution due to increase in population continues to progress in line with the breeding potential map of Hokkaido. Unfortunately, the population growth is challenged by issues such as (1) the lack of genetic diversity, (2) overconcentration of individuals at a few feeding stations, (3) overcrowding and exceeded carrying capacity in breeding grounds, (4) conflicts with farmers, (5) traffic accidents due to excessive habituation to people, and (6) breeding habitat degradation and disturbance of nesting activities by deer. Therefore, it is urgently necessary to consider future protection measures to maintain the population.","[Masatomi, Hiroyuki] Chuo Ku, Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan; [Masatomi, Yoshiyuki] Red Crowned Crane Conservancy, Kushiro, Hokkaido, Japan",masatm@cameo.plala.or.jp,37,5,5,SPRINGER-VERLAG SINGAPORE PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"152 BEACH ROAD, #21-01/04 GATEWAY EAST, SINGAPORE, 189721, SINGAPORE",2191-0707,ECOL RES MONOGR,,2018,,

Centuries old observations preserved within song, chant, and story has been globally recognized as a resource to integrate with conservation efforts for endangered species. In the case of the endemic land snails, kahuli, of the Hawaiian archipelago, there is a prominent cultural presence preserved in oral tradition and written records in 19th and early 20th century's Hawaiian language newspapers. As we witness the dramatic decimation of one of the greatest models of species radiation, the unveiling of the repositories of indigenous knowledge is crucial for conservation of these endemic land snails. This paper reports on indigenous knowledge that informs about the cultural significance (i.e., poetic device, metaphorical role, importance to hula) and ecology of kahuli, and how indigenous knowledge can contribute to conservation efforts of rare and endangered species.","[Sato, Aimee You; Price, Melissa Renae; Vaughan, Mehana Blaich] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Nat Resources & Environm Management, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA",aimeeysato@gmail.com,60,10,10,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",0894-1920,SOC NATUR RESOUR,Soc.

One common strategy applied by urban planners to manage urbanization and preserve natural resources is to make a comprehensive plan and concentrate future land use in certain areas. However, in practice, planners used to make future land use planning mainly based on their subjective interpretations with limited ecological supporting evidence and analysis. Here, we propose a new approach composed of ecological modelling and land use zoning in the spatial matrix to evaluate the comprehensive plan and identify priority lands for sustainable land use planning. We use the city of Corvallis, OR, as the test bed to demonstrate this new approach. The results indicate that the Corvallis Comprehensive Plan 1998-2020 featured with compact development is not performing efficiently in conserving ecological values, and the land use plan featured with mixed-use spreading development generated by the proposed approach meets the city's land demands for urban growth, and conserves 103% more ecological value of retaining storm water nitrogen, 270% more ecological value of retaining storm water phosphorus and 19% more ecological value in storing carbon in the whole watershed. This study indicates that if planned with scientific analysis and evidence, spreading urban development does not necessarily result in less sustainable urban environment than the compact development recommended in smart growth.","[Zhou, Long; Wu, Yao] City Univ Macau, Fac Urban Management & Studies, Taipa 999078, Macau, Peoples R China; [Wu, Yao; Zhu, Rong] Jiangnan Univ, Coll Design, Wuxi 214122, Peoples R China; [Woodfin, Tom] Univ Oklahoma, Coll Architecture, Norman, OK 73019 USA; [Chen, Tian] Tianjin Univ, Dept Urban Design & Planning, Tianjin 300072, Peoples R China",lzhou@cityu.mo; ywu@cityu.mo; twoodfin@ou.edu; zhurongseu@foxmail.com; chentian5561@vip.sina.com,70,3,3,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,2018,gold,

Remote sensing has transformed the monitoring of life on Earth by revealing spatial and temporal dimensions of biological diversity through structural, compositional and functional measurements of ecosystems. Yet, many aspects of Earth's biodiversity are not directly quantified by reflected or emitted photons. Inclusive integration of remote sensing with field-based ecology and evolution is needed to fully understand and preserve Earth's biodiversity. In this Perspective, we argue that multiple data types are necessary for almost all draft targets set by the Convention on Biological Diversity. We examine five key topics in biodiversity science that can be advanced by integrating remote sensing with in situ data collection from field sampling, experiments and laboratory studies to benefit conservation. Lowering the barriers for bringing these approaches together will require global-scale collaboration.","[Cavender-Bares, Jeannine] Univ Minnesota, Dept Ecol Evolut & Behav, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; [Schneider, Fabian D.; Schimel, David] CALTECH, Jet Prop Lab, Pasadena, CA USA; [Santos, Maria Joao] Univ Zurich, Dept Geog, Zurich, Switzerland; [Armstrong, Amanda; Fatoyinbo, Lola] NASA, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Biospher Sci Lab, Greenbelt, MD USA; [Carnaval, Ana] CUNY, Grad Ctr, Dept Biol, PhD Program Biol, New York, NY USA; [Dahlin, Kyla M.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Geog Environm & Spatial Sci, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Hurtt, George C.] Univ Maryland, Dept Geog Sci, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Townsend, Philip A.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Forest & Wildlife Ecol, Madison, WI USA; [Ustin, Susan L.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Land Air & Water Resources, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Ustin, Susan L.] Univ Calif Davis, John Muir Inst Environm, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Wang, Zhihui] Guangdong Acad Sci, Guangzhou Inst Geog, Key Lab Guangdong Utilizat Remote Sensing & Geog, Guangdong Open Lab Geospatial Informat Technol &, Guangzhou, Peoples R China; [Wilson, Adam M.] Univ Buffalo, Dept Geog, Buffalo, NY USA",cavender@umn.edu,200,0,0,NATURE PORTFOLIO,BERLIN,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, BERLIN, 14197, GERMANY",2397-334X,NAT ECOL EVOL,Nat.

However, these schemes may poorly represent ecologically relevant biological patterns required for effective design and management strategies. We used a community-level modeling approach to characterize and delineate representative mesoscale (tens to thousands of kilometers) assemblages of demersal fish and benthic invertebrates in the Northwest Atlantic. Hierarchical clustering of species occurrence data from four regional annual multispecies trawl surveys revealed three to six groupings (predominant assemblage types) in each survey region, broadly associated with geomorphic and oceanographic features. Indicator analyses identified 3-34 emblematic taxa of each assemblage type. Random forest classifications accurately predicted assemblage distributions from environmental covariates (AUC > 0.95) and identified thermal limits (annual minimum and maximum bottom temperatures) as important predictors of distribution in each region. Using forecasted oceanographic conditions for the year 2075 and a regional classification model, we projected assemblage distributions in the southernmost bioregion (Scotian Shelf-Bay of Fundy) under a high emissions climate scenario (RCP 8.5). Range expansions to the northeast are projected for assemblages associated with warmer and shallower waters of the Western Scotian Shelf over the 21st century as thermal habitat on the relatively cooler Eastern Scotian Shelf becomes more favorable. Community-level modeling provides a biotic-informed approach for identifying broadscale ecological structure required for the design and management of ecologically coherent, representative, well-connected networks of Marine Protected Areas. When combined with oceanographic forecasts, this modeling approach provides a spatial tool for assessing sensitivity and resilience to climate change, which can improve conservation planning, monitoring, and adaptive management.","[O'Brien, John M.; Stanley, Ryan R.

Thus, it is imperative to conserve the diversity of Sapindus. This study aimed to reveal the potential habitat distribution patterns of Sapindus mukorossi, Sapindus delavayi, and Sapindus rarak in response to the current environment and future climate change. Furthermore, we aimed to identify hotspots of habitat degradation/expansion to facilitate climate change-adaptive biological conservation. Using current environmental data and future climate projections (2021-2100), we simulated the present and potential future habitats of Sapindus mukorossi, Sapindus delavayi, and Sapindus rarak using a maximum entropy (MaxEnt) model that was developed based on 2041 occurrence records. The model showed that precipitation may play an important role in framing the potential habitats of Sapindus. Notably, S. delavayi was more sensitive to minimum temperatures (-4 degrees C to 5.5 degrees C), soil moisture (82-132 mm), and elevation (1200-3200 m), whereas S. rarak was the most sensitive to isothermality (50-86) and soil moisture (54-126). Under the current environment, Sapindus mukorossi had the widest suitable habitat distribution (252.50 x 104 km2), followed by that of Sapindus rarak (215.62 x 104 km2) and Sapindus delavayi (90.86 x 104 km2). Under future climate change scenarios, the habitat distribution of Sapindus mukorossi was predicted to expand at higher latitudes and extensively contract at lower latitudes. Moreover, the projected suitable habitat distribution of S. delavayi showed inconspicuous expansion and contraction, whereas that S. rarak underwent conspicuous contraction and expansion. Moreover, there were distinct ecological habits among Sapindus mukorossi, Sapindus delavayi, and Sapindus rarak in the east and southeast Asia. Thus, it is recommended that the contraction areas should be preferentially subjected to germplasm collection and conservation. Based on these findings, we propose preserved areas as the base for future Sapindus mukorossi, Sapindus delavayi, and Sapindus rarak conservation, breeding, cultivation, and utilisation.","[Liu, Jiming; Xu, Yuanyuan; Wang, Xin; Zheng, Yulin; Shi, Shuanglong; Chen, Zhong; Jia, Liming] Beijing Forestry Univ, Key Lab Silviculture & Conservat, Minist Educ, 35 Qinghua Rd, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China; [Liu, Jiming; Xu, Yuanyuan; Wang, Xin; Zheng, Yulin; Shi, Shuanglong; Chen, Zhong; Jia, Liming] Beijing Forestry Univ, Natl Energy R&D Ctr Nonfood Biamass, 35 E Qinghua Rd, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China; [Sun, Caowen] Nanjing Forestry Univ, Coll Forestry, Nanjing 210037, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [He, Qiuyang] China Jiliang Univ, Hangzhou 310018, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Weng, Xuehuang] Yuanhua Forestry Biol Technol Co Ltd, Sanming 650216, Fujian, Peoples R China",jlm@bjfu.edu.cn,88,0,0,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0378-1127,FOREST ECOL MANAG,For.

Connectivity through corridors is shaped by species' structural, ecological and behavioral constraints. In multi-use landscapes, species' interactions with humans could additionally influence connectivity. Using the tiger Panthera tigris as a case study, we make simultaneous assessments of potential connectivity, habitat use and examine their links with the species' negative interactions with humans in central India. We assessed potential connectivity across 10, 000 sq. km of the Kanha-Pench forest corridor using graph-theoretic methods. Combining indirect sign surveys and occupancy models, we examined habitat use, and evaluated its congruence with potential connectivity. Next, we estimated spatial probabilities of livestock depredation through application of multi-state occupancy models to interview-based survey data from local residents. Habitat use by tigers was negatively associated with forest fragmentation and anthropogenic disturbance. Livestock depredation was positively associated with size of settlements and areas most frequented by tigers, and negatively with anthropogenic disturbance within forests. We found high congruence between connectivity and habitat use (r = 0.80); but the strong correlation did not hold in areas with very high levels of livestock depredation levels. Our results indicate that when areas of high use by tigers are constrained by limited connectivity, there are higher chances of human-tiger conflict, and these areas may be ecological traps for the species. Interactions with humans can be crucial in mediating connectivity for large carnivores in shared habitats. Our findings present an opportunity to consolidate areas where carnivore conservation and local livelihood needs can be balanced. Our framework also provides a foundation for spatial prioritization that incorporates a plurality of dimensions, with utility for connectivity conservation of other wide-ranging carnivores.

We used a novel combination of fish tracking with expansive acoustic telemetry networks, stable isotope analysis and integrated modelling techniques to characterize the spatial and trophic ecology of a marine fish species, permit Trachinotus falcatus, and to address specific resource management needs in the Florida Keys. Tracking-based movement patterns indicated that permit remained primarily within the designated fisheries management unit (92% of individuals), but they moved frequently among distinct habitat types and fisheries. Movement metrics from 109 individuals were integrated into Bayesian isotope mixing models, revealing variable reliance on seagrass- versus offshore/pelagic-based energy channels amongst individuals. Variance was driven mainly by fish habitat use and home range size (km(2)). A telemetry-based regional isoscape, informed by individual-level estimates of resource use (% seagrass reliance; median = 70%, 29%-100% range), illustrated connectivity among habitats and fisheries. Specifically, seagrass flats were highly connected with the Florida reef tract, with frequent movements between these habitat types and a high reliance on seagrass-based prey. There was a distinction between these fish and those occupying artificial reefs, with the latter showing high use of pelagic/offshore (i.e. planktonic) energy channels. Synthesis and applications. This study used a novel combination of telemetry, stable isotope analysis and integrated modelling techniques to identify two distinct ecotypes of a nearshore fish species, permit, in the Florida Keys. Of the two ecotypes, nearshore Florida Keys permit support multiple valuable fisheries; for these fish management should prioritize conservation of seagrass flats as a key permit food source, as well as fisheries protection measures at spawning sites on the Florida reef tract.

In response to the development crisis triggered by ecological degradation, the Chinese government launched the National Barrier Zone (NBZ) Construction Program in 2006. However, few in-depth studies on the Loess Plateau Ecological Screen (LPES) have been conducted since the implementation of that program. To address this omission, based on the remote sensing image as the primary data, combined with meteorological, soil, hydrological, social, and economic data, and using GIS spatial analysis technology, this paper analyzes the change characteristics of the ecosystem pattern, quality, and dominant services of the ecosystem in the LPES from 2005 to 2015. The results show that from 2005 to 2015, the ecosystem structure in the study area was relatively stable, and the area of each ecosystem fluctuated slightly. However, the evaluation results based on FVC, LAI, and NPP showed that the quality of the ecosystem improved. The vegetation coverage (FVC) increased significantly at a rate of 0.91% per year, and the net primary productivity (NPP) had increased significantly at a rate of 6.94 gC/(m(2)center dot a) per year. The leaf area index (LAI) in more than 66% of the regions improved, but there were still about 8% of the local regions that were degraded. During these 10 years, the soil erosion situation in LPES improved overall, and the amount of soil conservation (ASC) of the ecosystem in the LPES increased by about 0.18 billion tons. Grassland and forest played important roles in soil conservation in this area. Pearson correlation analysis and redundancy analysis showed that the soil conservation services (SCS) in the LPES were mainly affected by climate change, economic development, and urban construction. The precipitation (P), total solar radiation (SOL), and temperature (T) can explain 52%, 30.1%, and 17% of the change trends of SCS, respectively.

We also explored the influence of the tourist cognition of ecology and its perceived value on the willingness to pay for the conservation of different species. Results indicated that the tourists are more willing to pay for Giant Pandas and Golden Monkeys. The tourist cognition of species affects mainly the willingness to pay, while the tourist cognition of wildlife importance mainly affects the payment. The tourists' perceived emotional and cost values have significant positive effects on the willingness to pay for the conservation of Giant Pandas/Golden Monkeys and Crested Ibises/Takins, respectively. Education and income levels have significant positive impacts on the willingness to pay and payment, respectively; therefore, it is necessary to publicise rare species, such as Crested Ibis and Takin, through natural education and experience to improve the tourist cognition of species and ecological environment.

Understanding movement patterns is crucial for the effective conservation of amphibian populations isolated by urban development. Here, we conducted a capture-recapture study over 6 years in a population of the fire salamander (Salamandra salamandra) inhabiting a 7.3-ha patch of forest and disturbed land-use types in an urbanised catchment north-west of Budapest, Hungary. We investigated relationships between movement distances and environmental, spatial and demographic parameters in order to understand how this species is able to persist in a relatively small and isolated habitat patch. We found that most movement was aggregated around a permanent stream and that movement distances were generally <= 200 m, with maximum distances of 925 and 707 m for males and females, respectively. Movement patterns within the population were best modelled using a negative exponential function characterised by infrequent long-distance movement. Males had substantially larger home range sizes than females and were predicted to have larger movement distances. Mean movement distances were predicted to be larger in disturbed areas in the upper stream catchment which included residential areas, compared with smaller movements in more natural forest near the stream. There was a positive relationship between mean movement distance and body condition. Our results suggest that this local population persists in a relatively small habitat patch because it provides a stable breeding site and suitable foraging and shelter microhabitats. Conservation of the local population requires protection of the structure, connectivity and quality of forest and stream habitats, and preventing urban development in the surrounding catchment.","[Kiss, I] Szent Istvan Univ, Dept Zool & Anim Ecol, Godollo, Hungary; [Voros, J.] Hungarian Nat Hist Museum, Dept Zool, Budapest, Hungary; [Hamer, A.

Four decades of conservation planning and implementation has seen the evolution of biodiversity protection, revegetation, bush rehabilitation and climate-ready habitat restoration. Relationships and trust have been built enabling the development of capacity in the farming community and conservation sector. This paper presents for the first time the chronology of four decades of landscape conservation planning and implementation in the Tasmanian Midlands. Remnant protection, restoration and revegetation efforts have evolved from the site level to landscape scale, leading to a conservation approach incorporating ecological restoration in its broadest sense. Successive iterations saw key initiatives including Midlands Bushweb, Midlandscapes, the Midlands Conservation Fund and the Tasmanian Island Ark project. Spatial tools and models have grown from simple maps and aerial photos to early GIS products including farm plans (revolutionary in their day) and asset maps, to increasingly complex spatial models of corridors using least-cost path analysis and fine-scale multi-species models of functional connectivity. However, critical to success in these challenging agricultural landscapes has been the relationships of trust and collaboration built between local farmers and conservation planners.","[Gilfedder, Louise] Univ Tasmania, Sch Technol Environm & Design, Private Bag 78, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia; [Gilfedder, Louise] Dept Primary Ind Pk Water & Environm, Hobart, Tas, Australia; [Appleby, Matt W.] Bush Heritage Australia, P0 Box 329,Flinders Lane, Parkville, Vic, Australia; [Lechner, Alex M.] Monash Univ Indonesia, Tangerang Selatan Banten 15345, Indonesia; [Sprod, Daniel] Tasmanian Land Conservancy, 827 Sandy Bay Rd, Sandy Bay 7005, Australia; [Sprod, Daniel] Ecosynth, 99 Church Rd, Barnes Bay 7150, Australia; [Carter, Oberon] Dept Primary Ind Pk Water & Environm, Threatened Species & Conservat Programs Branch, Parkville, Vic, Australia; [Burgess, Sebastian; Davidson, Neil J.; Harris, Rowan] Greening Australia, GPO Box 1191, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia; [Davidson, Neil J.] Univ Tasmania, Sch Nat Sci, Private Bag 55, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia; [Davidson, Neil J.] Univ Tasmania, Ctr Forest Value, Private Bag 55, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia",louise.gilfedder@gmail.com,48,7,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1442-7001,ECOL MANAG RESTOR,Ecol.

Ponds also provide important contributions to society through the provision of ecosystem services. Despite the ecological and societal importance of ponds, freshwater research, policy, and conservation have historically focused on larger water bodies, with significant gaps remaining in our understanding and conservation of pond ecosystems. In May 2019, pond researchers and practitioners participated in a workshop to tackle several pond ecology, conservation, and management issues. Nine research themes and 30 research questions were identified during and following the workshop to address knowledge gaps around: (1) pond habitat definition; (2) global and long-term data availability; (3) anthropogenic stressors; (4) aquatic-terrestrial interactions; (5) succession and disturbance; (6) freshwater connectivity; (7) pond monitoring and technological advances; (8) socio-economic factors; and (9) conservation, management, and policy. Key areas for the future inclusion of ponds in environmental and conservation policy were also discussed. Addressing gaps in our fundamental understanding of pond ecosystems will facilitate more effective research-led conservation and management of pondscapes, their inclusion in environmental policy, support the sustainability of ecosystem services, and help address many of the global threats driving the decline in freshwater biodiversity.","[Hill, Matthew J.; Milin, Melanie; Milner, Victoria S.] Univ Huddersfield, Sch Appl Sci, Huddersfield HD1 3DH, W Yorkshire, England; [Greaves, Helen M.; Sayer, Carl D.] UCL, Environm Change Res Ctr, Dept Geog, Pond Restorat Grp, Gower St, London WC1E 6BT, England; [Hassall, Christopher] Univ Leeds, Fac Biol Sci, Sch Biol, Woodhouse Lane, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England; [Marazzi, Luca] Florida Int Univ, Inst Environm, Miami, FL 33199 USA; [Hall, Ruth] Nat England, Nat England Mail Hub, Worcester Cty Hall,Spetchley Rd, Worcester WR5 2NP, England; [Harper, Lynsey R.] Liverpool John Moores Univ, Sch Biol & Environm Sci, Liverpool L3 3AF, Merseyside, England; [Thornhill, Ian] Bath Spa Univ, Sch Sci, Newton St Loe, Bath BA2 9BN, Avon, England; [Walton, Richard] Newcastle Univ, Sch Geog Polit & Sociol, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England; [Biggs, Jeremy; Ewald, Naomi] Freshwater Habitats Trust, Bury Knowle House, Oxford OX3 9HY, England; [Law, Alan; Willby, Nigel] Univ Stirling, Biol & Environm Sci, Stirling FK9 4LA, Scotland; [White, James C.] Cranfield Univ, River Restorat Ctr, Cranfield MK43 0AL, Beds, England; [Briers, Robert A.] Edinburgh Napier Univ, Sch Appl Sci, Edinburgh EH11 4BN, Midlothian, Scotland; [Mathers, Kate L.] Dept Surface Waters Res & Management, CH-6047 Kastanienbaum, Switzerland; [Mathers, Kate L.; Wood, Paul J.] Loughborough Univ, Ctr Hydrol & Ecosyst Sci, Dept Geog, Loughborough LE11 3TU, Leics, England; [Jeffries, Michael J.] Northumbria Univ, Dept Geog & Environm Sci, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 8ST, Tyne & Wear, England",m.hill@hud.ac.uk,150,1,1,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2150-8925,ECOSPHERE,Ecosphere,2021,"Green Published, Green Accepted, gold",

A literature review on this topic is missing so far. We fill this gap with an emphasis on the temperate forests of Europe and North America. Mixed-ownership landscapes are the special focus of the analysis. In a first step, historical effects of ownership patterns on forest structure and biodiversity are elucidated. Second, connections between present-time forest ownership patterns and both forest structural and biodiversity patterns are analyzed. Finally, implications for integrative conservation management are evaluated with a special focus on mixed-ownership forest landscapes. Recent Findings Close linkages between ownership type-specific forest management and particular forest structural and biodiversity patterns are identified for past and current forest landscapes. Both in Europe and North America, publicly and privately owned forests show comparable lines of historical development but with a time shift. Forest reserves and ancient woodland with long ecological continuity appear to be mainly connected with public ownership. A high diversity of management approaches and cultural landscape habitats is characteristic of non-industrial small private forests. In mixed-ownership landscapes, a more diverse mosaic of habitats has developed than in mono-ownership landscapes. We conclude that cross-boundary ecosystem management is crucial for effective conservation in present-day mixed-ownership landscapes. Integrative forest management that considers biodiversity and social-ecological aspects across ownerships is indispensable. We present a framework of implications for conservation management in mixed-ownership forest landscapes that build on each other and may enhance cross-boundary ecosystem management.","[Moelder, Andreas] Northwest German Forest Res Inst NW FVA, Dept Forest Nat Conservat, Prof Oelkers Str 6, D-34346 Munden, Germany; [Tiebel, Malin; Plieninger, Tobias] Univ Gottingen, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, Pl Gottinger Sieben 5, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany; [Plieninger, Tobias] Univ Kassel, Fac Organ Agr Sci, Steinstr 19, D-37213 Witzenhausen, Germany",moelder@gmx.de,179,1,1,SPRINGER INT PUBL AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2198-6436,CURR FOR REP,Curr.

Within this field, mathematically modeling the effects of poaching threats on managerial decision-making is a novel approach. To fill this scientific gap, the present paper uses a security game approach to model the interactions between an environmental manager (defender) and a group of profit-seeking pursuit poachers (attackers) who target species which are nodes of the food web. Based upon the non-cooperative Stackelberg game, the objective of the defender (as leader) is to keep the food web at or near equilibrium through optimally manipulating the populations of an optimal subset of species. In contrast, each attacker strives to maximize monetary profit by hunting an optimal population size of the selected species. The model is validated by a numerical example examining the food web of the endangered Persian leopard (Panthera pardus saxicolor), which lives in Golestan National Park (GNP), Iran. The model provides an overarching biotic intervention strategy to keep the (1 predator-4 prey) food web near equilibrium, while only 2 prey species (the urial (Ovis vignei) and the red deer (Cervus elaphus)) are directly threatened by poachers. The examination revealed that both species population data and poaching data should be taken into account to set effective multi-species conservation prioritization levels. In a sensitivity analysis approach, it was found that, despite the fact that red deer is endangered and preferred by poachers, the deterrent penalty measure should be 1.5 times greater for poaching urial than red deer. The output analysis illustrated that, in order to bring the urial deterrent penalty measure closer to the red deer one, enforcement measures should be about 2.5 times stricter for poaching urial than red deer. The results specifically yield insight into how to optimally conserve a food web equilibrium under poaching pressure and within several constraints.","[Gatmiry, Zohreh S.; Hafezalkotob, Ashkan] Islamic Azad Univ South Tehran Branch, Coll Ind Engn, Entezari Alley,Oskoui Alley,Choobi Bridge, Tehran, Iran; [Bafruei, Morteza Khakzar] Univ Sci & Culture, Ind Engn Dept, Tehran, Iran; [Soltani, Roya] KHATAM Univ, Dept Ind Engn, Tehran, Iran",a_hafez@azad.ac.ir,74,0,0,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1476-945X,ECOL COMPLEX,Ecol.

However, the extent to which global climate change (GCC) and habitat loss compromise their conservation status remains unclear. Herein, we proposed to: (1) assess how predicted GCC impacts the distribution of non-migrant hummingbirds according to their conservation status, degree of restriction and habitat specificity; and (2) delineate priority conservation areas where species could persist in the face of both threats. We estimated the potential distributions of 49 species under current and future climates (year 2040, 2060, and 2080), analyzing the effects of current habitat loss and the importance of existing Protected Areas (PAs) on the species' ranges and hummingbird hotspot areas in Mexico. Our projections were consistent in the identity of the species that are most vulnerable to GCC: while 10.2% of species will have potentially habitat gains/stability (winners), the remaining 89.8% of species (losers) will face habitat reductions under new climate conditions. These changes were mostly related to temperature increases (>2 degrees C) and rainfall decreases (<50 mm). The combined impacts of GCC and habitat loss may represent a higher risk, leading to an average reduction of 26-59% in species' ranges. Already-established Mexican PAs cover 12% of the hummingbirds' current ranges, but showed an important reduction of surface across the species distribution (on average >15%) and hotspot areas (>60%) for future. We identified highly resilient priority areas across southern Mexico, in Oaxaca and Guerrero. Ambitious conservation actions by decision-makers are now crucial to avoid losing these highly-vulnerable taxa. (C) 2021 Associac , ao Brasileira de Ciencia Ecologica e Conservaca.

Here, we review the opportunities and challenges that such technology might afford in the field of conservation and ecology. SmallSat constellations may yield higher resolutions than those that are currently available to scientists and practitioners, increasing opportunities to improve environmental-monitoring and animal-tracking capabilities. They may cut access costs to end users, by reducing operational costs and bringing increased competition to the existing market. Their greater flexibility and affordability may moreover enable the development of bespoke constellations for specific conservation and ecological applications, and provide greater interoperability with ground-based sensors, such as tracking devices and camera traps. In addition, SmallSats may serve as cost-effective research and development platforms for new components and products. Combined, these benefits could significantly improve our ability to monitor threats to the environment as they unfold, while enhancing our understanding of animal ecology and ecosystem dynamics. However, significant hardware and software developments are required before such technology is able to produce, process and handle reliable and cost-effective data, and the initial research and development costs still represent a major challenge. Further, we argue that much remains to be done to ensure these new data products become accessible, equitable and sustainable.","[Curnick, David J.; Duncan, Clare; Freeman, Robin; Jacoby, David M.

We present a systematic review and narrative synthesis of 169 publications investigating how different forms of governance influence conservation outcomes, paying particular attention to the role played by Indigenous peoples and local communities. We find a stark contrast between the outcomes produced by externally controlled conservation, and those produced by locally controlled efforts. Crucially, most studies presenting positive outcomes for both well-being and conservation come from cases where Indigenous peoples and local communities play a central role, such as when they have substantial influence over decision making or when local institutions regulating tenure form a recognized part of governance. In contrast, when interventions are controlled by external organizations and involve strategies to change local practices and supersede customary institutions, they tend to result in relatively ineffective conservation at the same time as producing negative social outcomes. Our findings suggest that equitable conservation, which empowers and supports the environmental stewardship of Indigenous peoples and local communities represents the primary pathway to effective long-term conservation of biodiversity, particularly when upheld in wider law and policy. Whether for protected areas in biodiversity hotspots or restoration of highly modified ecosystems, whether involving highly traditional or diverse and dynamic local communities, conservation can become more effective through an increased focus on governance type and quality, and fostering solutions that reinforce the role, capacity, and rights of Indigenous peoples and local communities. We detail how to enact progressive governance transitions through recommendations for conservation policy, with immediate relevance for how to achieve the next decade's conservation targets under the UN Convention on Biological Diversity.","[Dawson, Neil M.; Bennett, Nathan J.] Int Union Conservat Nat, Commiss Environm Econ & Social Policy, Gland, Switzerland; [Dawson, Neil M.; Coolsaet, Brendan] Lille Catholic Univ, European Sch Polit & Social Sci ESPOL, Lille, France; [Dawson, Neil M.; Coolsaet, Brendan] French Fdn Res Biodivers FRB, Ctr Synth & Anal Biodivers CESAB, Montpellier, France; [Dawson, Neil M.; Coolsaet, Brendan] Univ East Anglia, Sch Int Dev, Global Environm Justice Grp, Norwich, Norfolk, England; [Sterling, Eleanor J.] Amer Museum Nat Hist, Ctr Biodivers & Conservat, New York, NY 10024 USA; [Loveridge, Robin] Univ York, Dept Environm & Geog, York, N Yorkshire, England; [Loveridge, Robin] Biodivers Consultancy, Cambridge, England; [Gross-Camp, Nicole D.] Royal Bot Garden Edinburgh, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland; [Wongbusarakum, Supin] One People One Reef, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland; [Wongbusarakum, Supin] Univ Hawaii, Sea Grant Coll Program, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Wongbusarakum, Supin] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Nat Resources & Environm Management, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Sangha, Kamaljit K.] Charles Darwin Univ, Darwin Ctr Bushfire Res DCBR, Res Inst Environm & Livelihoods RIEL, Darwin, NT, Australia; [Scherl, Lea M.] James Cook Univ, Cairns Inst, Townsville, Qld, Australia; [Phan, Hao Phuong] UCL, Inst Educ, London, England; [Zafra-Calvo, Noelia] Univ Basque Country, Basque Ctr Climate Change, Sci Campus, Bilbao, Spain; [Lavey, Warren G.] Univ Illinois, Sch Earth Soc & Environm, Chicago, IL 60680 USA; [Lavey, Warren G.] Univ Illinois, Coll Law, Chicago, IL 60680 USA; [Byakagaba, Patrick] Makerere Univ, Sch Forestry Environm & Geog Sci, Kampala, Uganda; [Idrobo, C.

We used ecological niche models (ENMs) to predict the occurrence of western rattlesnakes (Crotalus oreganus) in British Columbia (BC), Canada. We applied this to existing population estimates to support a threshold of occurrence for management and conservation. We also identified predictors influencing rattlesnake distribution and abundance in this region. Using a Geographic Information Systems platform, we incorporated ENMs, capture-mark-recapture (CMR) and radio-telemetry results, province-wide observations, Landsat imagery and provincial databases for agricultural land use to produce quantitative, spatially explicit, population estimates across BC. Using available western rattlesnake habitat estimated at 183.9 km(2) and averaging estimates calculated from densities in three study populations, we generated a mean adult population size of 9722 (& PLUSMN;SD 3009; 0.8 relative index of occurrence [RIO] threshold). Only a small area (21.6 km(2)) of suitable land cover was located within protected areas, potentially protecting an estimated 1144 (& PLUSMN;354) adults. Most suitable land cover was within 500 m of roads (170.6 km(2)), representing potential habitat being used by an estimated 9017 (& PLUSMN;2791) adults. At the threshold RIO value chosen (0.8), only a very small area of farmland provided suitable land cover. Our results highlight the possibility of high mortality rates for western rattlesnakes near roads and the fact that protected areas do not provide sufficient coverage to conserve the population. Given that this species has relatively low mobility and high site fidelity to home ranges, our population estimate for BC provides a useful reference for the northern part of the species' range. It also fulfills a need to estimate population size within political jurisdictions where conservation management decisions are made, as well as presenting a method that can be applied to other parts of the range, including the southern United States. Our study provides an important benchmark for future monitoring of western rattlesnakes in BC using a repeatable and transparent approach. Similar applications can be extrapolated and applied for other threatened species to identify and quantify population distributions and threats, further supporting conservation prioritization tools to be used to maximize the effectiveness of conservation strategies under financial constraints.</p>","[Kirk, David Anthony; Karimi, Sahebeh] Aquila Conservat & Environm Consulting, CP 87, Ottawa, ON K0A 1K0, Canada; [Maida, Jared R.] Canadian Wildlife Serv, Environm & Climate Change Canada, 1238 Discovery Ave,1st Floor, Kelowna, BC V1V 1V9, Canada; [Harvey, Jessica A.] Corvidae Environm Consulting, 6526 Water St, Sooke, BC V9Z 0X1, Canada; [Larsen, Karl W.] Thompson Rivers Univ, Dept Nat Resource Sci, 805 TRU Way, Kamloops, BC V2C 0C8, Canada; [Bishop, Christine A.] Environm & Climate Change Canada, Sci & Technol Branch, Wildlife Res Div, 5421 Robertson Rd, Delta, BC V4K 3N2, Canada",david@aquilaecology.com; sahebeh.karimi@gmail.com; jared.maida@ec.gc.ca; j_harvey@outlook.com; klarsen@tru.ca; christine.bishop@ec.gc.ca,146,0,0,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,DIVERSITY-BASEL,Diversity-Basel,2021,gold,

Hence, this study reports in Nigeria, for the first time, the occurrence and habitat specificity of the larva of Pentaphlebia stahli (Zygoptera: Pentaphlebiidae) a vulnerable damselfly. Methods Samples of P. stahli were collected in July and December 2020 from a rural stream situated at the Ekor Waterfalls in the Cross River State of Nigeria and very close to the Nigeria-Cameroon border. Some water quality parameters were also measured in each sampling period. Results A total of 27 larvae of P. stahli and 1 teneral adult emerging from its exuvia were recorded in the two sampling periods. The habitat was a forested stream characterized by rapids, falls, and dark rock substrata. Water flows at a fast rate of 1 m in 3 or 4 seconds, thus characterizing a rifle and headwater stream. Dissolved oxygen concentration was between 8.05 and 8.09 mg/L, while dissolved oxygen saturation was similar to 98%. Biological oxygen demand was between 1.04 and 1.08 mg/L, while pH ranged from 7.28 and 7.56. Conclusion The stream could be described as having high ecological integrity as evidenced in its optimum range of values for the investigated water parameters and the presence of a threatened species. Implications for Conservation Based on habitat specificity, P. stahli is considered an umbrella species required for conserving other co-occurring species in the tropical stream and its riparian forest.","[Akindele, Emmanuel O.; Adedapo, Abiodun M.; Ogbogu, Sylvester S.] Obafemi Awolowo Univ, Dept Zool, Room 1-07, Ife, Osun State, Nigeria; [Adu, Babasola W.] Fed Univ Technol Akure, Dept Biol, Akure, Nigeria",eoakindele@oauife.edu.ng,20,0,0,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1940-0829,TROP CONSERV SCI,Trop.

However, it is still unclear how to prioritize biodiversity conservation in the remaining grassland patches in this fragmented landscape. Here, we investigated 84 remaining grassland patches in the Tabu River Basin, a typical area of agro-pastoral ecotone of northern China. To determine the conservation priorities of these remaining grassland patches, we used a new conservation criterion called ecological uniqueness based on beta diversity. We further explored the impact of local habitat, dispersal process, and patch characteristics on ecological uniqueness. Our results showed that turnover was the dominant component of regional beta diversity (accounting for 81.9%). We identified 13 hotspots patches with high conservation priority due to their significant ecological uniqueness, 9 of which were small patches (<5 ha). Local habitat explained more variation of the ecological uniqueness than dispersal process and patch characteristics, with local precipitation heterogeneity the key influencing factor. We also found a positive correlation between patch fractal dimension and ecological uniqueness. Our study suggests that small remaining grassland patches are hotspots of regional biodiversity conservation in the fragmented landscape of agro-pastoral ecotone of northern China. We highlight that it is necessary to focus on the habitat heterogeneity and patch shape of these small patches to determine conservation prioritization.","[Yan, Yongzhi; Zhang, Qing; Zhang, Shuangshuang; Han, Peng; Liu, Qingfu; Liu, Pengtao] Inner Mongolia Univ, Sch Ecol & Environm, Minist Educ, Key Lab Ecol & Resource Use Mongolian Plateau, Hohhot 010021, Peoples R China; [Jarvie, Scott] Otago Reg Council, Dunedin 9016, New Zealand; [Zhang, Qing] Minist Educ China & Inner Mongolia Autonomous Reg, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Grassland Ecol Secur, Hohhot 010021, Peoples R China; [Liu, Qingfu] Guizhou Univ, Coll Forestry, Guiyang 550025, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Qing] Qufu Normal Univ, Ctr Land Studies, Rizhao 276826, Peoples R China",qzhang82@163.com,71,0,0,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1470-160X,ECOL INDIC,Ecol.

The effectiveness of this trade-off for the facilitation of co-existence, however, is likely to depend on the spatial arrangement of the habitat, because too strong agglomeration of the habitat may overly benefit the strong competitor (being the poor disperser), implying extinction of the inferiour competitor, while too much dispersion of the habitat may drive the superiour competitor (being the inferiour coloniser) to extinction. In working landscapes, biodiversity conservation is often induced through conservation payments that offset the forgone profits incurred by the conservation measure. To control the spatial arrangement of conservation measures and habitats in a conservation payment scheme, the agglomeration bonus has been proposed to provide financial incentives for allocating conservation measures in the vicinity of other sites with conservation measures. This paper presents a generic spatially explicit ecological-economic simulation model to explore the ability of the agglomeration bonus to cost-effectively conserve multiple competing species that differ by their competition strengths, their colonisation rates and their dispersal ranges. The interacting effects of the agglomeration bonus and different species traits and their trade-offs on the species richness in the model landscape are analysed. Recommendations for the biodiversity-maximising design of agglomeration bonus schemes are derived.","[Drechsler, Martin] UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Ecol Modelling, Leipzig, Germany; [Drechsler, Martin] Brandenburg Univ Cottbus Senftenberg, Chair Econ Particular Environm Econ, Cottbus, Germany",martin.drechsler@ufz.de,43,0,0,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",2296-701X,FRONT ECOL EVOL,Front.

Here, we divided the Mekong River into 37 sub-basins to explore the alpha and beta taxonomic and functional diversity of fish fauna and the explanatory power of environmental and spatial factors on fish diversity. We found that species and functional richness varied significantly along environmental gradients, while functional evenness and divergence were weakly correlated with environmental variables. We also found that the high taxonomic beta diversity was mainly contributed by the turnover component, while that of the functional facet was mainly due to the nestedness component. In addition, environmental filtering played a more important role than spatial factors in structuring both taxonomic and functional facets of fish communities. Finally, we found that environmental filtering was more important in determining taxonomic structure than functional structure, which was opposite to the general understanding that functional traits should be better associated with environmental variation.

It is regarded as the most endangered cetacean in the western South Atlantic. Five management units are recognized (Franciscana Management Areas, FMAs - sensu Secchi et al., 2003a), with abundance estimates ranging from a few hundred to around 15,000 dolphins. Low reproductive potential and short life span make this species highly susceptible to current non-natural removal rates. Bycatch in gillnet fisheries occurs in high levels since the 1960s in Uruguay and 1980s in Brazil and Argentina. Although other threats exist, such as habitat degradation that includes physical (noise) and chemical pollution, depletion of fish stocks and climate change, incidental mortality in gillnets is currently the greatest threat to franciscanas. Fishing-related mortality ranges from approximately 100, in FMA I, to more than 1,000 in FMA III, and exceed from near two (in FMA IV) to more than five times (in FMA III) the maximum allowed sustainable mortality rate, based on potential biological removal (PBR) approach. These numbers indicate that the species is unlikely to cope with the current levels of bycatch and that urgent and extreme reduction on fishing practice and effort are required to avoid collapse of the franciscana and to lower its risk of extinction. Current mortality levels and projected declines resulted in the listing of the franciscana as Vulnerable in the IUCN Red List. Recent fisheries regulations were implemented in areas with extensive bycatch in Brazil and were expected to improve the species' conservation status. There is evidence, however, that this regulation is insufficient to reduce fishing-related mortality to sustainable levels due to either or both lack of compliance and inadequate regulation strategies. Here we provide a comprehensive review on the franciscana ecology and threats and discuss perspectives for its conservation.","[Secchi, Eduardo R.] Univ Fed Rio Grande, Lab Ecol & Conservacao Megafauna Marinha, Ist Oceanog, Rio Grande, Brazil; [Cremer, M.

Species within the EAS-ENA disjunct genera are presumed to exhibit niche conservatism, the tendency of closely related species to be more ecologically similar, reflecting lineages' common evolutionary history. However, the hypothesis has not been well examined at the species level. Location EAS and ENA. Time period Current. Major taxa studied Species within the EAS-ENA disjunct genera. Methods We compiled data on climate, species occurrence, growth form, and phylogeny to examine niche conservatism. We first built a phylogenetic tree to select intercontinental congeneric pairwise species and obtained their divergence times. We then quantified the observed niche overlaps with Schoener's D, which has a 0-1 range, based on species occurrence and climate of species' native ranges. To obtain projected distributions, each species' niche was projected to the non-native region using ensemble ecological niche models. Projected-related niche overlaps were then calculated using projected distributions and the corresponding climatic conditions. Results Average observed niche overlaps of congeneric pairwise species were relatively small: .124, .211 and .109 for all, herbaceous and woody species, respectively. Both observed and projected-related niche overlaps had significant negative relationships with divergence times of intercontinental congeneric pairwise species, with niche overlap for herbaceous species being higher than that for woody plants when controlling for divergence times. Main conclusions We conclude that the significant negative relationships between niche overlap and divergence times of congeneric pairwise species confirm niche conservatism among species of EAS-ENA disjunct plants and that the extent of niche conservatism is slightly different for herbaceous and woody plants. These findings suggest the potential role of allopatric speciation in EAS, and could help to understand the evolutionary history and the Asian-bias diversity pattern of the EAS-ENA disjunct plants.","[Yin, Xue; Chu, Chengjin] Sun Yat Sen Univ, State Key Lab Biocontrol, Guangzhou 510275, Peoples R China; [Yin, Xue; Chu, Chengjin] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Life Sci, Guangzhou 510275, Peoples R China; [Yin, Xue; Jarvie, Scott; Guo, Wen-Yong; Svenning, Jens-Christian] Aarhus Univ, Dept Biol, Sect Ecoinformat & Biodivers, Aarhus, Denmark; [Jarvie, Scott; Guo, Wen-Yong; Svenning, Jens-Christian] Aarhus Univ, Ctr Biodivers Dynam Changing World BIOCHANGE, Dept Biol, Aarhus, Denmark; [Jarvie, Scott] Otago Reg Council, Dunedin, New Zealand; [Guo, Wen-Yong] East China Normal Univ, Sch Ecol & Environm Sci, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Deng, Tao] Chinese Acad Sci, Kunming Inst Bot, CAS Key Lab Plant Div & Biogeog East Asia, Kunming, Yunnan, Peoples R China; [Mao, Lingfeng] Nanjing Forestry Univ, Coll Biol & Environm, Coinnovat Ctr Sustainable Forestry Southern China, Nanjing, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Minhua; He, Fangliang] East China Normal Univ, Zhejiang Tiantong Forest Ecosyst Natl Observat &, ECNU Alberta Joint Lab Biodivers Study, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Qian, Hong] Illinois State Museum, Res & Collect Ctr, Springfield, IL USA; [He, Fangliang] Univ Alberta, Dept Renewable Resources, Edmonton, AB, Canada",chuchjin@mail.sysu.edu.cn,96,1,1,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1466-822X,GLOBAL ECOL BIOGEOGR,Glob.

Although rescues may be considered a wildlife stewardship behavior, not all 'rescues' may be warranted. Some animals are more likely to be brought into a rescue center than others, suggesting that human drivers underlying wildlife rehabilitation efforts are important to understand for urban conservation efforts. Literature has primarily focused on understanding the ecological drivers and implications of wildlife rescues. Our study is the first to investigate both the social and ecological drivers of bird rescues using census, household survey, and intake data. In Phoenix metropolitan area, Arizona, USA in 2017-2018, we found doves and common species were sent to the center most often. Altricial species (helpless at hatching) and young birds were more likely to be brought to the center, perhaps due to perceptions of young animals as vulnerable. We found rescues came from neighborhoods with higher incomes and residents with pro-ecological worldviews, perhaps reflecting a perceived responsibility for wildlife. Conversely, few rescues came from neighborhoods with a high percentage of Hispanic/Latinx residents, who often feel more interdependent with nature. Neighborhoods with greater numbers of rescues were more likely to have residents participating in yard stewardship activities as compared to neighborhoods with fewer rescues. Our findings are relevant to understanding drivers of wildlife stewardship actions and for intake centers who wish to reduce the occurrence of people bringing in wildlife that do not need to be rescued.","[Andrade, R.] Arizona State Univ, Sch Geog Sci & Urban Planning, 975 S Myrtle Ave, Tempe, AZ 85281 USA; [Bateman, H.

Thus, assessing patterns of LULCC is crucial to foresee potential future developments and to develop sustainable future management strategies. In this study, we use a multi-method scenario approach to assess the spatial implications and underlying driving forces of potential change by (1) developing a System Dynamics Causal Loop Diagram (CLD) to disentangle the underlying socio-economic and ecologic driving forces, (2) deriving a qualitative business-as-usual (BAU) and a conservation scenario from participatory narratives elaborated during a stakeholder workshop, and (3) quantifying the spatial implications of these scenarios with the Land Change Modeler (LCM). Results indicate that under the BAU assumption only 37% of the natural vegetation is expected to persist until 2030 in the wetland. In contrast, strict enforcement of protected areas (conservation scenario) halts further conversion of the wetland. However, both scenarios pinpoint considerable expansions of cropland in the western highlands with potentially serious impacts on catchment-wide hydrological processes.

Bsal poses an imminent threat to global salamander diversity owing to its wide host range, high pathogenicity, and long-term persistence in ecosystems. While there is a pressing need to develop further research and conservation actions, data limitations inherent to recent pathogen emergence obscure necessary insights into Bsal disease ecology. Here, we use a hierarchical modeling framework to describe Bsal landscape epidemiology of outbreak sites in light of these methodological challenges. Using model selection and machine learning, we find that Bsal presence is associated with humid and relatively cool, stable climates. Outbreaks are generally located in areas characterized by low landscape heterogeneity and low steepness of slope. We further find an association between Bsal presence and high trail density, suggesting that human-mediated spread may increase risk for spillover between populations. We then use distribution modeling to show that favorable conditions occur in lowlands influenced by the North Sea, where increased survey effort is needed to determine how Bsal impacts local newt populations, but also in hill- and mountain ranges in northeastern France and the lower half of Germany. Finally, connectivity analyses suggest that these hill- and mountain ranges may act as stepping stones for further spread southward. Our results provide initial insight into regional environmental conditions underlying Bsal epizootics, present updated invasibility predictions for northwestern Europe, and lead us to discuss a wide variety of potential survey and research actions needed to advance future conservation and mitigation efforts.","[Beukema, Wouter; Erens, Jesse; Stegen, Gwij; Martel, An; Pasmans, Frank] Univ Ghent, Wildlife Hlth Ghent, Fac Vet Med, Salisburylaan 133, B-9820 Merelbeke, Belgium; [Beukema, Wouter] Naturalis Biodivers Ctr, POB 9517, NL-2300 RA Leiden, Netherlands; [Schulz, Vanessa; Steinfartz, Sebastian] Univ Leipzig, Inst Biol, Mol Evolut & Systemat Anim, Talstr 33, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany; [Schulz, Vanessa] Tech Univ Carolo Wilhelmina Braunschweig, Div Evolutionary Biol, Zool Inst, Mendelssohnstr 4, D-38106 Braunschweig, Germany; [van der Sluijs, Annemarieke Spitzen-; Stark, Tariq] Reptile Amphibian & Fish Conservat Netherlands RA, Toernooiveld 1, NL-6525 ED Nijmegen, Netherlands; [Laudelout, Arnaud; Kinet, Thierry] Natagora, Traverse Muses 1, B-5000 Namur, Belgium; [Kirschey, Tom] Nat & Biodivers Conservat Union NABU, Charitestr 3, D-10117 Berlin, Germany; [Poulain, Marie; Miaud, Claude] Paul Valery Univ Montpellier III, Univ Montpellier, CNRS, Biogeog & Vertebrate Ecol,CEFE,EPHE PSL, 1919 Route Mende, F-34293 Montpellier, France",wouter.beukema@ugent.be,76,0,0,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1051-0761,ECOL APPL,Ecol.

Avian conservation naturally lends itself to translational ecology because birds are well studied, typically widespread, often exhibit migratory behaviors transcending geopolitical boundaries, and necessitate coordinated conservation efforts to accommodate resource and habitat needs across the full annual cycle. In this perspective, we highlight several case studies from bird conservation practitioners and the ornithological and conservation social sciences exemplifying the 6 core translational ecology principles introduced in previous studies: collaboration, engagement, commitment, communication, process, and decision-framing. We demonstrate that following translational approaches can lead to improved conservation decision-making and delivery of outcomes via co-development of research and products that are accessible to broader audiences and applicable to specific management decisions (e.g., policy briefs and decision-support tools). We also identify key challenges faced during scientific producer-user engagement, potential tactics for overcoming these challenges, and lessons learned for overcoming the research-implementation gap. Finally, we recommend strategies for building a stronger translational ecology culture to further improve the integration of these principles into avian conservation decisions. By embracing translational ecology, avian conservationists and ornithologists can be well positioned to ensure that future management decisions are scientifically informed and that scientific research is sufficiently relevant to managers. Ultimately, such teamwork can help close the research-implementation gap in the conservation sciences during a time when environmental issues are threatening avian communities and their habitats at exceptional rates and at broadening spatial scales worldwide.","[Saunders, Sarah P.; Wu, Joanna X.; Bateman, Brooke L.; Michel, Nicole L.; Smith, Melanie A.] Natl Audubon Soc, Sci Div, New York, NY 10014 USA; [Gow, Elizabeth A.] Univ Guelph, Dept Integrat Biol, Guelph, ON, Canada; [Adams, Evan] Biodivers Res Inst, Portland, ME USA; [Bayard, Trina] Audubon Washington, Seattle, WA USA; [Beilke, Stephanie] Audubon Great Lakes, Chicago, IL USA; [Dayer, Ashley A.] Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Dept Fish & Wildlife Conservat, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA; [Fournier, Auriel M., V] Univ Illinois, Prairie Res Inst, Illinois Nat Hist Survey, Forbes Biol Stn Bellrose Waterfowl Res Ctr, Havana, IL USA; [Fox, Kara] Natl Audubon Soc, Gulf Coast Restorat, Mobile, AL USA; [Heglund, Patricia] US Fish & Wildlife Serv, Natl Wildlife Refuge Syst, Bloomington, MN USA; [Lerman, Susannah B.] USDA, Forest Serv Northern Res Stn, Amherst, MA USA; [Paxton, Eben H.] US Geol Survey, Pacific Isl Ecosyst Res Ctr, Hawaii Natl Pk, Hawaii, HI USA; [Sekercioglu, Cagan H.] Univ Utah, Sch Biol Sci, Salt Lake City, UT USA; [Sekercioglu, Cagan H.] Koc Univ, Fac Sci, Istanbul, Sariyer, Turkey; [Thogmartin, Wayne] US Geol Survey, Upper Midwest Environm Sci Ctr, La Crosse, WI USA; [Woodrey, Mark S.] Mississippi State Univ, Coastal Res & Extens Ctr, Starkville, MS USA; [Woodrey, Mark S.] Mississippi Dept Marine Resources, Grand Bay Natl Estuarine Res Reserve, Moss Point, MS USA; [van Riper, Charles, III] Univ Arizona, Southwest Biol Sci Ctr, US Geol Survey, Tucson, AZ USA; [van Riper, Charles, III] Univ Arizona, Sch Nat Resources & Management, Tucson, AZ USA",sarah.saunders@audubon.org,69,3,3,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0010-5422,ORNITHOL APPL,Ornithol.

Increased attention to the social and cultural factors that shape environmental outcomes is needed for these collaborative teams to function effectively. Mental models are cognitive representations of the external world which guide an individual's thinking, decision-making, and behavior. They are critical elements of collaborative environmental management because they shape our understanding of socialecological systems, our perceptions of environmental problems, and our preferences for certain management actions. In this paper, we describe an iterative process of constructing and revising mental models at both individual and small group levels over the course of a year in a community-based conservation area in the Ethiopian highlands. We compared mental models of the conservation area from four groups involved in management to identify commonalities and differences in the way people conceptualize the area. While we found high variability in mental models both within and across groups, most participants perceived social, economic, and political variables to be the key drivers of change in this system. Economic variables were also identified as key sensitivities, along with biotic and livelihood variables. However, groups differed considerably in how they thought about relationships between these variables, particularly political and economic variables. We used interviews with participants to assess how they learned throughout the mental modeling process, finding evidence of changes to stakeholder relationships, system understanding, and the time horizons used in planning. Women farmers differed from other groups at multiple stages in our process, both in the structure of the models they produced and in the social learning they experienced. Our study was strengthened by the iterative process that allowed individuals and small groups to reflect on their own understanding and share it with others, resulting in increased communication, mutual respect, and understanding among members of the management team. These findings point to the complementarity of both individual and group-level mental modeling for nuanced system understanding, and emphasize the need for diverse perspectives in collaborative environmental management in order for holistic understanding of both problems and solutions to emerge.","[Steger, Cara; Klein, Julia A.] Colorado State Univ, Nat Resource Ecol Lab, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Steger, Cara; Marinkovich, Jake; Klein, Julia A.] Colorado State Univ, Dept Ecosyst Sci & Sustainabil, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Gebrehiwot, Kflay; Chengere, Shambel Alemu; Dullo, Bikila Warkineh; Zewde, Sisay Wube] Addis Ababa Univ, Dept Plant Biol & Biodivers Management, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia; [Zewde, Sisay Wube] Ethiopian Biodivers Inst, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia",Cara.Steger20@alumni.colostate.edu,50,2,2,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",1462-9011,ENVIRON SCI POLICY,Environ.

Species-specific information on the effects of urbanization is often a limiting factor in designing and implementing effective biodiversity strategies. In suburban and exurban areas, amphibians play an important social-ecological role between people and their environment and contribute to ecosystem health. Amphibians are vulnerable to threats and imbalances in the aquatic and terrestrial environment due to a biphasic lifestyle, making them excellent indicators of local environmental health. We developed a citizen science program to systematically monitor amphibians in a large city in Alberta, Canada, where 90% of pre-settlement wetlands have been removed and human activities continue to degrade, alter, and/or fragment remaining amphibian habitats. We demonstrate successes and challenges of using publicly collected data in biodiversity monitoring. Through amphibian monitoring, we show how a citizen science program improved ecological knowledge, engaged the public in urban biodiversity monitoring and improved urban design and planning for biodiversity. We outline lessons learned to inform citizen science program design, including the importance of early engagement of decision makers, quality control assessment, assessing tensions in program design for data and public engagement goals, and incorporating conservation messaging into programming.","[Lee, Tracy S.; Kahal, Nicole L.; Kinas, Holly L.; Sanderson, Ken; Duke, Danah] Mt Royal Univ, Miistakis Inst, Rm U271 Mt Royal Univ,4825 Mt Royal Gate SW, Calgary, AB T3E 6K6, Canada; [Randall, Lea A.] Calgary Zoo Fdn, 1300 Zoo Rd NE, Calgary, AB T2E 7V6, Canada; [Baker, Tyne M.] A Vian Ecological Consulting Inc, 619 29 Ave NW, Calgary, AB T2M 2M8, Canada; [Carney, Vanessa A.] Urban Conservat Dept, POB 2100,Stn M,54, Calgary, AB T2P 2M5, Canada; [Kendell, Kris] Alberta Conservat Assoc, 101,9 Chippewa Rd, Sherwood Pk, AB T8A 6J7, Canada",tracy@rockies.ca; nicole@rockies.ca; holly@rockies.ca; LeaR@calgaryzoo.com; tyne.baker@avianeco.com; Vanessa.Carney@calgary.ca; Kris.Kendell@ab-conservation.com; ken@rockies.ca; danah@rockies.ca,79,1,1,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,DIVERSITY-BASEL,Diversity-Basel,2021,gold,

Since their rediscovery, several organisations have sought to conserve these critically endangered apes, resulting in a crisis conservation narrative focused on the threats posed by local human activities. However, landscapes are not just ecological, they are also social, shaped by political and economic processes. This study examines the interconnections between humans and gorillas by approaching the Mone-Oku forest as a combination of ecological, social, and political systems. Through a combined use of botanical surveys, analyses of nesting sites, participant observation, and semistructured interviews, we obtained nuanced ecological and ethnographic insights into the human-gorilla interface. The results illustrate a history of alterations within the Mone-Oku forest, some of which are human-induced. These alterations have had both positive and negative outcomes for the gorillas and continue to the present day, where political history has shaped limited livelihood alternatives, increasing the reliance on a forest that has remained a constant in the more recent history of developmental neglect and isolation. However, this situation is not static, with future alterations to the forest also subject to regional and international political and economic influences, such as the increased worldwide demand for cacao.","[Wade, Alison H.; Malone, Nicholas] Univ Auckland, Sch Social Sci, Anthropol, Auckland 1142, New Zealand",awad010@auddanduni.ac.nz; n.malone@auckland.ac.nz,121,0,0,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,DIVERSITY-BASEL,Diversity-Basel,2021,gold,

The success of MPAs, and therefore the delivery of their potential outcomes for human well-being and global sustainability, requires multi-disciplinary, holistic, and comprehensive approaches for its achievement. In this study, the global scientific literature on MPAs was quantitatively reviewed through bibliometrics approaches, investigating patterns and trends in its development over time. In particular, bibliometric network and citation burst analyses of keywords were performed using VOSviewer and CiteSpace software. The bibliographic search on the Scopus and Web of Science databases resulted in a total number of 5908 and 6036 scientific documents published on MPAs. The network analysis of the keywords co-occurrence produced four main clusters whose connections and overlapping showed a multidisciplinary structure of MPA science, in which the ecological, social, and economic domains of research are strongly interlinked. Temporal analyses showed a recent focus on topics related to the social-ecological systems theory (e.g., ecosystem services, marine spatial planning, governance, and small-scale fisheries) suggesting that newer research lines recognize the importance of integrating the ?human dimension? in conservation and sustainability studies. Overall, the results of both the performed bibliometric analyses pointed out the evolution of MPA science from the conventional concept of ?marine reserves? to a broader scope integrating ecological, economic, and social aspects. In conclusion, MPA research is timely responding to the identification of MPAs as ocean sustainability tools, opening MPA science to multi-disciplinary research lines by linking the ecological and socio-economic dimensions of sustainability. MPA research is expected to play a crucial role in generating the interdisciplinary scientific knowledge needed to fully contribute to global ocean sustainability and human wellbeing.","[Picone, F.; Buonocore, E.; Russo, G.

In contrast, secondary riparian forests can recover stream habitats and fish assemblages as they recover structural attributes and ecological processes. We evaluated whether the amount and condition of secondary riparian forests were important to conserve fish assemblages in 49 streams sites in eastern Amazonia. We related fish assemblage taxonomic and functional measures to riparian forest amount plus different habitat metrics using regression analysis. We compared assemblage measures among reference forests, abandoned pastures (open canopy), and secondary forests (closed canopy) using ANOVA tests. The amount of secondary forests had little influence on fish assemblages. Species richness, diversity, and functional richness were higher in pasture than in reference sites but returned to pre-disturbance conditions in secondary sites. However, functional evenness was lower in pasture streams and did not recover after secondary forest regrowth. Our results show that secondary riparian forest condition is important to recover some aspects of fish assemblages. However, streams bordered by these forests may have impoverished fish assemblages because some lost sensitive species may take longer to return. Avoiding riparian deforestation is the best strategy to reduce losses in aquatic biodiversity and ecosystem functions in tropical agricultural landscapes.","[de Paula, Felipe Rossetti; Leal, Cecilia Gontijo; Ferraz, Silvio Frosini de Barros] Univ Sao Paulo, Dept Forest Sci Luiz de Queiroz, Coll Agr, Ave Padua Dias,11,CP 9, BR-13418900 Piracicaba, SP, Brazil; [Leitao, Rafael Pereira] Univ Fed Minas Gerais, Inst Biol Sci, Dept Genet Ecol & Evolut, Ave Presidente Antonio Carlos 6627, BR-31270901 Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil; [Pompeu, Paulo Santos] Univ Fed Lavras, Dept Biol, Ave Cent S-N Campus Univ, BR-37200900 Lavras, MG, Brazil; [Zuanon, Jansen Alfredo Sampaio] Natl Inst Amazonia Res, Biodivers Themat Grp, Ave Andre Araujo 2936, BR-69067375 Manaus, Amazonas, Brazil; [Hughes, Robert M.] Oregon State Univ, Amnis Opes Inst, 2895 Southeast Glenn St, Corvallis, OR 97333 USA; [Hughes, Robert M.] Oregon State Univ, Dept Fisheries & Wildlife, 2895 Southeast Glenn St, Corvallis, OR 97333 USA",ferossetti@gmail.com,105,2,2,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0018-8158,HYDROBIOLOGIA,Hydrobiologia,,,

While several short-term studies elucidate the impacts of fires on local plant diversity, how plant diversity responds to fire regimes over long timescales (>100 years) is a significant knowledge gap, posing substantial impediment to evidence-based management of tropical social-ecological systems. Using wet evergreen forests of the Western Ghats of India as a model system, we discuss the synergistic effects of anthropogenic fires and enhanced aridity on tropical plant diversity over the past 4000 years by examining fossil pollen-based diversity indices (e.g., pollen richness and evenness, and temporal beta-diversity), past fire management, the intervals of enhanced aridity due to reduced monsoon rainfall and land use history. By developing a historical perspective, our aim is to provide region-specific management information for biodiversity conservation in the Western Ghats. We observe that the agroforestry landscape switches between periods of no fires (4000-1800 yr BP, and 1400-400 yr BP) and fires (1800-1400 yr BP, and 400-0 yr BP), with both fire periods concomitant with intervals of enhanced aridity. We find synergistic impacts of anthropogenic fires and aridity on plant diversity uneven across time, pointing towards varied land management strategies implemented by the contemporary societies. For example, during 1800-1400 yr BP, diversity reduced in conjunction with a significant decrease in the canopy cover related to sustained use of fires, possibly linked to large-scale intensification of agriculture. On the contrary, the substantially reduced fires during 400-0 yr BP may be associated with the emergence of sacred forest groves, a cultural practice supporting the maintenance of plant diversity. Overall, notwithstanding apparent changes in fires, aridity, and land use over the past 4000 years, present-day plant diversity in the Western Ghats agroforestry landscape falls within the range of historical variability. Importantly, we find a strong correlation between plant diversity and canopy cover, emphasising the crucial role of maintenance of trees in the landscape for biodiversity conservation. Systematic tree management in tropical socialecological systems is vital for livelihoods of billions of people, who depend on forested landscapes. In this context, we argue that agroforestry landscapes can deliver win-win solutions for biodiversity as well as people in the Western Ghats and wet tropics at large.","[Kulkarni, Charuta; Bhagwat, Shonil A.] Open Univ, Dept Geog, Gardiner 221,Walton Hall, Milton Keynes MK7 6AA, Bucks, England; [Kulkarni, Charuta; Bhagwat, Shonil A.] Open Univ, OpenSpace Res Ctr, Milton Keynes MK7 6AA, Bucks, England; [Finsinger, Walter] Univ Montpellier, ISEM, CNRS, EPHE,IRD, F-34095 Montpellier 5, France; [Anand, Pallavi] Open Univ, Sch Environm Earth & Ecosyst Sci, Milton Keynes MK7 6AA, Bucks, England; [Nogue, Sandra] Univ Southampton, Sch Geog & Environm Sci, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England; [Nogue, Sandra; Bhagwat, Shonil A.] Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, Oxford Long Term Ecol Lab, Oxford OX1 3SZ, England",ckulkarni@gradcenter.cuny.edu,117,1,2,ACADEMIC PRESS LTD- ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,LONDON,"24-28 OVAL RD, LONDON NW1 7DX, ENGLAND",0301-4797,J ENVIRON MANAGE,J.

However, a lack of social stimuli and conspecific cueing at these habitats may limit the use of these sites, at least in the short term. Therefore, testing the effectiveness of simulated audio-visual cues for attracting gregarious birds is important for conservation planning. In this study, we (1) assessed whether call playback and decoys were associated with an increased likelihood of Australian fairy terns Sternula nereis nereis visiting potentially suitable nesting habitats; (2) tested their behavioral response to different cues; and (3) documented whether social facilitation had the potential to encourage colony establishment. A full cross-over study design consisting of all possible pairings of decoy and call playback treatments (control [no attractants], decoys, call playback, both decoys and playback), allocated as part of a random block design, was undertaken at 2 sites. Linear modeling suggested that call playback was important in explaining the time spent aerial prospecting as well as the maximum number of fairy terns aerial prospecting, although this only appeared to be the case for 1 of the 2 sites. Decoys, on the other hand, did not appear to have any effect on time spent aerial prospecting. The results from this study suggest that audio cues have the potential to encourage site selection by increasing social stimuli, but attractants may be required over several breeding seasons before colonies are established.","[Greenwell, C.

Yet there remains a lack of detailed research concerning how these programs and their value frames are operationalized in practice. The article attempts to advance this literature through an empirical exploration of practices undertaken by diverse actors that work to produce and extract value from 'wild' natures, specifically elephants for 'conservation hunting' in Namibian communal-area conservancies. Conceptually, the article also contributes to an emerging body of work seeking to 'ecologise' political ecology, exploring the co-optation of lively elephants and other beyond-human entities in the production of economic value. 'Following' the elephant's interactions with other living entities, the article reveals the (non)human work and social practices that together 'labor' to produce commodified elephants that can be killed as trophies. We argue that 'undesirable encounters' such as crop raiding by elephants are both indicative of unequal power relations amongst CBNRM stakeholders and central to (re)producing dominant (neoliberal) value frames. The animal's spontaneous activities are co-opted into technocratic governance practices that legitimize the killing of elephants on environmental and economic grounds In opening up the contested, contingent, and more-than-human nature of these social-ecological relations we also hope to contribute to possibilities for imagining more equitable and ecologically resilient conservation futures.","[Hewitson, Lee] Univ Dundee, Dundee, Scotland; [Sullivan, Sian] Bath Spa Univ, Environm & Culture, Bath, Avon, England",ljhewitson@yahoo.co.uk; s.sullivan@bathspa.ac.uk,145,1,1,UNIV ARIZONA LIBRARIES,TUCSON,"UNIV ARIZONA LIBRARIES, TUCSON, AZ 85721 USA",1073-0451,J POLIT ECOL,J.

However, in the following year, environmentalists took on the issue from the standpoint of biodiversity conservation leading to members of the Muslim community reacting against perceived injuries.

The focus is to 1) trace how socio-political changes during and after colonization transformed the hunting and wildlife conservation discourse in southern Africa, and 2) to address how previous conservation injustices were addressed through benefit-based approaches like CAMPFIRE, adopted in Zimbabwe after colonization. Some 144 published journal articles, books and other source materials were consulted. The review indicates that political changes in southern Africa profoundly transformed the conservation and trophy hunting narrative. This narrative had varied impacts and outcomes for different groups of people. Although a number of benefit-based approaches, like CAMPFIRE reflected a complete departure from past conservation policies, they continue to attract praise and criticisms since opinions differ among stakeholders, especially over extractive activities like trophy hunting and its associated benefits. I conclude that political developments impacted on conservation and trophy hunting in a profound way and that although post-colonial, pro-community conservation programs have inherent weaknesses, to a greater extent they addressed past conservation-based injustices. Continuous monitoring and area-specific adaptive management of wildlife and its sustainable management is recommended for long-term conservation benefits and community livelihoods.","[Muboko, Never] Chinhoyi Univ Technol, Dept Wildlife Ecol & Conservat, Private Bag 7724, Chinhoyi, Zimbabwe",,145,0,0,UNIV ARIZONA LIBRARIES,TUCSON,"UNIV ARIZONA LIBRARIES, TUCSON, AZ 85721 USA",1073-0451,J POLIT ECOL,J.

Here we use movement behavior to understand the ecology and social biology of the poorly known southern three-banded armadillo (Tolypeutes matacus). We used VHF and GPS telemetry to monitor 26 individuals from two sites in the Pantanal wetlands of Brazil. We characterized armadillo activity patterns, evaluated the relationship between sex and body mass with home range size and mean daily distance traveled, and examined home and core range overlap. Three-banded armadillos were active on average for 5.5 +/- 2.8 h/day, with most of their activity concentrated in the first half of the night. Adult males were heavier and had larger home ranges than adult females. Home range size scaled positively with body mass for males, but not for females. Core ranges for females overlapped little (< 1%) regardless of age, but home ranges for males overlapped both with other males (12%) and females (18%). Our data suggest that three-banded armadillos are mainly a nocturnal species. Home range and spacing patterns point to a generally asocial behavior and a polygynous or promiscuous mating system. We hope that the data generated as a result of this project will contribute to this species' conservation in Brazil and elsewhere by guiding future management and research efforts.","[Attias, N.] Univ Fed Mato Grosso do Sul, Programa Posgrad Ecol & Conservacao, BR-79070900 Campo Grande, MS, Brazil; [Attias, N.; Mourao, G.] Embrapa Pantanal, BR-79320900 Corumba, MS, Brazil; [Attias, N.] Univ Fed Mato Grosso do Sul, Programa Posgrad Biol Anim, BR-79070900 Campo Grande, MS, Brazil; [Gurarie, E.; Fagan, W.

It is thought to be restricted to five sites in Britain. However, information on these remaining populations is limited. Knowledge on population size, habitat and forage requirements and foraging distance, are important for successful conservation of species. The population of A.retusaat the Seaford Head Nature reserve in East Sussex was surveyed. Transects within the reserve were conducted and population estimates using mark recapture were made for 2018 and 2019. Pollen from foraging females was analysed alongside visual sightings to determine forage requirements. The total population was estimated to be 91 in 2018 (males and females) with an estimated male population of 167 in 2019. The most visited flower species by females wasGlechoma hederacea(66% of visits) but flower preference changed throughout the flight season, shifting to Fabaceae species andIris foetidissimawith 16 plant groups identified in pollen samples. Bees were geographically restricted to a small area within the reserve (approximately 30 ha). Although the exact location of nesting sites was not determined with certainty it is thought nests are in the loess deposits at the top of the inaccessible sea cliff face. This project suggests the presence of appropriate nesting sites may be limiting A.retusadistribution as they appear to forage on common plant species. More research is needed on the exact nesting requirements of the species. Implications for Insect Conservation The findings from this paper help contribute to the limited understanding of the ecology of this rare and declining species. By knowing the forage requirements of A.retusa, other areas where it is found can ensure these are present within a short distance of nest sites, hopefully ensuring the survival of individual populations and therefore the species.","[Hennessy, Georgia; Goulson, Dave; Ratnieks, Francis L.

These keystone communities face important threats (e.g. climate change) that place their conservation at risk and in turn the sustainability of the ecosystems they inhabit. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop ecosystem management strategies to ensure their protection. However, to provide a solid path towards biocrust conservation, the understanding by stakeholders and governance structures of the ecological functions of these communities, their role as benefit providers, and the pressures threatening their important effects are indispensable. Whereas the ecological scope of biocrust has been widely studied in the last decades, the social dimension of their role remained unexplored. By reviewing literature in biocrusts from a social-ecological approach, here we identified knowledge gaps and new research areas that need to be addressed in order to produce scientific knowledge that better guides dryland conservation policies and actions.

While efforts to reverse the current global environmental crisis increase, we are still experiencing unprecedented rates of species' extinctions. Traditional cultural landscapes can potentially play an important role for biodiversity conservation globally. However, these landscapes are threatened by pressures from global to local socio-economic drivers of change. Many cultural landscapes across the world occur on private land where landowners' environmental stewardship can help support nature conservation. 2. In this study, we applied a place-based collaborative approach to understand the main aspects underlying landowners' relationship with nature, their perceptions of the local social-ecological context and their vision of a desired future to identify the constraints and opportunities to support voluntary private land conservation. The study was conducted in Uruguay, in a traditional cattle ranching cultural landscape, which is a national priority area for the conservation of biodiversity. In Uruguay, approximately 96% of the land is privately owned, while the National System of Protected Areas covers only similar to 1% of the land. 3. Our results revealed that landowners had a close relationship with nature and considered themselves and their neighbours as local environmental stewards. Landowners were well aware of the importance of nature contributions to their livelihood and lifestyle and were concerned that rural exodus to urban areas and shrubland encroachment would negatively impact the social-ecological context they value and depend upon. Main needs of landowners to support biodiversity conservation were not primarily motivated by economic interests, but more related to the need for support that could enhance land management and social cohesion. 4. Biodiversity conservation goals in this cultural landscape cannot be pursued in isolation from social and rural development goals. Addressing local needs based on already existing links between nature's contributions and people might help support biodiversity conservation in the area. Failing to understand the context and to recognize locally perceived problems could increase the risk of voluntary conservation failure. Our approach and lessons learned can provide insights to actionable research in other cultural landscapes globally.","[Cortes-Capano, Gonzalo; Toivonen, Tuuli; Minin, Enrico Di] Univ Helsinki, Dept Geosci & Geog, Helsinki, Finland; [Cortes-Capano, Gonzalo; Soutullo, Alvaro; Fernandez, Andres] Univ Republ, Ctr Univ Reg Este, Dept Ecol & Gest Ambiental, Maldonado, Uruguay; [Cortes-Capano, Gonzalo; Fernandez, Andres; Dimitriadis, Caterina] Vida Silvestre Uruguay, Montevideo, Uruguay; [Toivonen, Tuuli; Minin, Enrico Di] Univ Helsinki, Helsinki Inst Sustainabil Sci, Helsinki, Finland; [Toivonen, Tuuli] Univ Cambridge, Dept Zool, Conservat Sci Grp, Cambridge, England; [Garibotto-Carton, Gustavo] Minist Vivienda Ordenamiento Terr & Medio Ambient, Sistema Nacl Areas Protegidas, Montevideo, Uruguay; [Minin, Enrico Di] Univ KwaZulu Natal, Sch Life Sci, Durban, South Africa",gonzalo.cortescapano@helsinki.fi,130,7,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",,PEOPLE NAT,People Nat.,2020,"Green Published, gold",

CWR are generally underrepresented in genebanks, while their survival in nature is not guaranteed. Inventories and risk analyses are needed to prioritize CWR for conservation in order to ensure that they remain available for utilization. Here the effects of climate change on the distribution of 214 CWR in the Netherlands are predicted by ecological niche modelling and related to data on IUCN conservation status and variation in key ecological habitat factors. It is shown that climate change is expected to affect red list species as well as species that currently are of least concern. Particularly worrisome is the finding that already critically endangered CWR show the largest expected loss of distribution area. In general, reduced distribution areas show a geographical shift to more northern locations in the Netherlands. No clear relationship is found between changes in distribution and the habitat characteristics vegetation structure, nutrient level, moisture condition, salinity and acidity. A moderate positive correlation is observed between ecological amplitude and tolerance level to climatic change.

Uncertainty in historical, current and future effectiveness of actions hampers decisions about how to mitigate changes to prevent biodiversity loss and species extinctions. Research in resource management, agriculture and health indicates that forecasts predicting the effects of near-term or seasonal environmental conditions on management greatly improve outcomes. Such forecasts help resolve uncertainties about when and how to operationalize management. We reviewed the scientific literature on environmental management to investigate whether near-term forecasts are developed to inform biodiversity decisions in Australia, a nation with one of the highest recent extinction rates across the globe. We found that forecasts focused on economic objectives (e.g. fisheries management) predict on significantly shorter timelines and answer a broader range of management questions than forecasts focused on biodiversity conservation. We then evaluated scientific literature on the effectiveness of 484 actions to manage seven major terrestrial threats in Australia, to identify opportunities for near-term forecasts to inform operational conservation decisions. Depending on the action, between 30% and 80% threat management operations experienced near-term weather impacts on outcomes before, during or after management. Disease control, species translocation/reintroduction and habitat restoration actions were most frequently impacted, and negative impacts such as increased species mortality and reduced recruitment were more likely than positive impacts. Drought or dry conditions, and rainfall, were the most frequently reported weather impacts, indicating that near-term forecasts predicting the effects of low or excessive rainfall on management outcomes are likely to have the greatest benefits. Across the world, many regions are, like Australia, becoming warmer and drier, or experiencing more extreme rainfall events. Informing conservation decisions with near-term and seasonal ecological forecasting will be critical to harness uncertainties and lower the risk of threat management failure under global change.","[Tulloch, Ayesha I.

We propose an integrated assessment of the social-ecological interactions of the area to support future sustainable management. Within the Drivers-Pressures-State-Impact-Response (DPSIR) framework an integrated literature review and several methods of knowledge collection were combined to identify future management priorities and challenges. During focus groups with farmers and pastoralists, stakeholders confirmed the role played by land use changes as driver and pressure in the landscape, e.g. through increased erosion rates and siltation of the lake. Moreover, economic and social issues were identified as prominent factors being influenced by, or influencing these processes. These statements match the scientific literature. During participatory mapping exercises different spatial and resource allocation perceptions appeared amongst pastoralists and farmers. The multidisciplinary approach proved to be useful to acquire an integrated and comprehensive understanding of the state, challenges and opportunities of Lake Manyara BR, to feed into a decision support system in service of an integrated management plan. Our assessment suggests that improved water governance in a multi-actor approach (with a focus on distribution of benefits, rights, and a specific role of the water authorities) should be a priority for future integrated management strategies. Also, awareness raising amongst decision makers, scientists and local communities is needed to demonstrate the advantages of an integrated approach. And finally, visible and fair mechanisms to share conservation revenues should be designed in a way that local benefits can be obtained together with incentive mechanisms for co-management and conservation.","[de Bisthoven, L.

The importance of Local Ecological Knowledge (LEK) in data-poor scenarios is increasingly recognized in conservation, both in terms of uncovering historical trends and for engaging community stewardship of historic information. Building on previous work in marine historical ecology and local ecological knowledge, we propose a mixed socio-ecological framework to reliably document and quantify LEK to reconstruct historical population trends. Our method can be adapted by interdisciplinary teams to study various long-lived taxa with a history of human use. We demonstrate the validity of our approach by reconstructing long-term abundance data for the heavily-exploited East Pacific green turtle (Chelonia mydas) in Baja California, Mexico, which was driven to near extinction by a largely unregulated fishery from the early 1950s to the 1980s. No scientific baseline abundance data were available for this time-frame because recent biological surveys started in 1995 after all green turtle fisheries in the area were closed. To fill this data gap, we documented LEK among local fishers using ethnographic methods and obtained verified, qualitative data to understand the socio-environmental complexity of the green turtle fishery. We then established an iterative framework to synthesize and quantify LEK using generalized linear models (GLMs) and non-linear regression (NLR) to generate a standardized, LEK-derived catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) time-series. CPUE is an index of abundance that is compatible with contemporary scientific survey data. We confirmed the accuracy of LEK-derived CPUE estimates via comparisons with fisheries statistics available for 1962-1982. We then modeled LEK-derived abundance trends prior to 1995 using NLR. Our model established baseline abundance and described historical declines, revealing that the most critical (exponential) decline occurred between 1960 and 1980. This robust integration of LEK data with ecological science is of critical value for conservation and management, as it contributes to a holistic view of a species' historic and contemporary conservation status.","[Early-Capistran, Michelle-Maria] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Ciencias Mar & Limnol, Mexico City, DF, Mexico; [Solana-Arellano, Elena] Ctr Invest Cient & Educ Super Ensenada, Dept Ecol Marina, Ensenada, Baja California, Mexico; [Alberto Abreu-Grobois, F.] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Unidad Acad Mazatlan, Inst Ciencias Mar & Limnol, Mazatlan, Sinaloa, Mexico; [Narchi, Nemer E.] Colegio Michoacan Sede Piedad, Ctr Estudios Geog Humana, CoLaboratorio Oceanog Social, La Piedad, Michoacan, Mexico; [Garibay-Melo, Gerardo] Univ Autonoma Baja Calif, Manejo Ecosistemas Zonas Aridas, Ensenada, Baja California, Mexico; [Seminoff, Jeffrey A.] NOAA, Southwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, La Jolla, CA USA; [Koch, Volker] Deutsch Gesell Int Zusammenarbeit GIZ GmbH, Bonn, Germany; [Saenz-Arroyo, Andrea] Colegio Frontera ECOSUR, Dept Conservac Biodiversidad, San Cristobal Las Casas, Chiapas, Mexico",esolana@cicese.mx,82,5,5,PEERJ INC,LONDON,"341-345 OLD ST, THIRD FLR, LONDON, EC1V 9LL, ENGLAND",2167-8359,PEERJ,PeerJ,2020,"Green Published, gold",

Since 2000, conservation policies and ecological restoration projects, e.g., the Grain for Green Project (GGP), have been implemented on the Guizhou Plateau to control soil/water losses which have achieved notable accomplishments. Using the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) to estimate the soil conservation service (SCS) on the Guizhou Plateau, this study analyzed the dynamic characteristics of its spatiotemporal variation based on multiyear (2000-2018) meteorological and remote sensing data to determine its driving mechanisms. Residual analysis of the meteorological and remote sensing data was used to evaluate the effect of anthropogenic activities. Results showed a clear upward trend (1.39 t ha(-1)yr(-1)) of SCS on the Guizhou Plateau during 2000-2018, and areas with a highly improved positive effect on SCS were distributed primarily in karst landform regions. Precipitation and vegetation fractional coverage (VFC) were found to be positively correlated with SCS on the Guizhou Plateau. Specifically, the highest proportion of significant positive correlation between precipitation and SCS was related to the Wildlife Conservation Nature Reserve (WCNR), and the highest proportion of significant positive correlation between VFC and SCS was related to the GGP, i.e., 76.59% and 53.02%, respectively. Residual analysis revealed a significant positive role of anthropogenic activity on SCS improvement via ecological engineering in areas with a poor ecological background, e.g., the GGP in western areas where the ecological environment is fragile and the problem of water/soil loss is serious. In areas with a more robust ecological background, e.g., the engineering area of the WCNR, the effect of anthropogenic activity has had a largely negative effect on SCS.

In southern Africa, where many PLCAs rely on trophy hunting as an income-generating strategy, a potential ban on trophy hunting locally or abroad holds unknown consequences for the future conservation of these lands. In this study, we investigate the consequences of a potential trophy hunting ban in PLCAs in two biodiversity hotspots in South Africa's Eastern and Western Cape provinces. We used semistructured interviews with PLCA managers and owners to elicit perceived impacts of an internationally imposed trophy hunting ban on conservation activities in PLCAs, and to probe alternative viable land uses. The majority of interviewees believed that both the economic viability of their PLCA and biodiversity would be lost following a hunting ban. Owners would primarily consider transitioning to ecotourism or livestock farming, but these options were constrained by the social-ecological context of their PLCA (e.g., competition with other PLCAs, ecological viability of farming). Our results suggest that a trophy hunting ban may have many unintended consequences for biodiversity conservation, national economies, and the livelihoods of PLCA owners and employees.

In a collaborative manner, we designed a structured elicitation process and statistical framework to combine indigenous knowledge with survey data to model the distribution of a threatened and culturally significant species (greater bilby ormankarr[Macrotis lagotis]). We used Martu (Aboriginal people of the Australian western deserts) occurrence knowledge and presence data from track-based surveys to create predictive species distribution models with the Maxent program. Predictions of species distribution based on Martu knowledge were broader than those created with survey data. Together the Martu and survey models showed potential local declines, which were supported by Martu observation. Both data types were influenced by sampling bias that appeared to affect model predictions and performance. Martu provided additional information on habitat associations and locations of decline and descriptions of the ecosystem dynamics and disturbance regimes that influence occupancy.

These fishes attain a maximum body weight of >= 30 kg. Global population declines highlight the need for more information about megafishes' conservation status to inform management and conservation. The northern Cambodian Mekong River and its major tributaries are considered one of the last refugia for Mekong megafishes. We collected data on population abundance and body size trends for eight megafishes in this region to better understand their conservation statuses. Data were collected in June 2018 using a local ecological knowledge survey of 96 fishers in 12 villages. Fishers reported that, over 20 years, most megafishes changed from common to uncommon, rare, or locally extirpated. The most common and rarest species had mean last capture dates of 4.5 and 95 months before the survey, respectively. All species had declined greatly in body size. Maximum body weights reported by fishers ranged from 11-88% of their recorded maxima. Fishers identified 10 threats to megafishes, seven of which were types of illegal fishing. Electrofishing was the most prevalent. Results confirm that Mekong megafishes are severely endangered. Species Conservation Strategies should be developed and must address pervasive illegal fishing activities, alongside habitat degradation and blocked migrations, to recover declining populations.","[Campbell, Teresa; Hogan, Zeb] Univ Nevada, Dept Biol, Reno, NV 89557 USA; [Campbell, Teresa; Hogan, Zeb] Univ Nevada, Global Water Ctr, Reno, NV 89557 USA; [Pin, Kakada] Royal Univ Phnom Penh, Ctr Biodivers Conservat, Phnom Penh 12156, Cambodia; [Pin, Kakada; Ngor, Peng Bun] Inland Fisheries Res & Dev Inst, Wonders Mekong Project, Phnom Penh 12300, Cambodia; [Ngor, Peng Bun] Fisheries Adm, Inland Fisheries Res & Dev Inst, Phnom Penh 12300, Cambodia",tcampbs@gmail.com; pin.kakada77@gmail.com; pengbun.ngor@gmail.com; zhogan@unr.edu,68,11,11,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,WATER-SUI,Water,2020,gold,

Among these, nutrient over-enrichment, resulting in eutrophication, has been a major concern. The EU Water Framework Directive (WFD) has initiated public action to improve their water quality and ecosystem state using an approach rooted in restoration ecology. Here we analyze how this has been applied for the coastal lagoons in South France, considering eutrophication as an example of ecosystem degradation and oligotrophication as the corresponding trajectory for ecological restoration of the eutrophied coastal lagoons. Oligotrophication trajectories, initiated by the reduction of external nutrient loading, have resulted in a quick recovery (i.e., within 3 years) of integrative water column variables (Chlorophyll a, total N and P) and phytoplankton. Starting from hypertrophic systems, the oligotrophication trajectory is described by a sequence of three ecosystem states dominated respectively by (i) phytoplankton with bare non-vegetated sediments, (ii) opportunistic macroalgae, (iii) angiosperm and perennial macroalgae, punctuated by regime shifts between these ecosystem states. Nevertheless, the latter regime shift has not been observed for the most degraded ecosystems after 10-years oligotrophication. The N and P accumulated in sediments during eutrophication may also retard the ecological restoration. In shallow freshwater lakes, the phytoplankton-dominated and the angiosperm-dominated states are also characteristic for highly degraded and fully restored ecosystems states, respectively. In contrast, opportunistic macroalgae do not bloom in these systems. Hence, the alternative stable state model, used successfully for these lakes, cannot be applied straightforwardly for coastal lagoons. To be successful, ecological restoration should consider the legislative and societal questions as according the DPSIR framework it typically is a response of society. The conservation-oriented Habitats Directive systematically applies to coastal lagoons and the Birds Directive in some cases as well. The WFD approach is complementary to these more conventional nature conservation approaches. Collectively, local citizens and highly involved stakeholders strongly value the coastal lagoons and attribute very high importance to their regulating ecosystem services (ESs), while differences between stakeholder profiles are related to different perceptions and appreciations of cultural ESs. Hence, coastal lagoon ESs are very important for the different stakeholders and public policies aiming at the ecological restoration of these ecosystems may count on public support.","[De Wit, Rutger; Leruste, Amandine; Le Fur, Ines; Sy, Mariam Maki; Bec, Beatrice] Univ Montpellier, CNRS, MARBEC, Ifremer,IRD, Montpellier, France; [Le Fur, Ines; Ouisse, Vincent; Derolez, Valerie] Univ Montpellier, CNRS, MARBEC, Ifremer,IRD, Sete, France; [Rey-Valette, Helene] Univ Montpellier, CNRS, CEE M, Montpellier SupAgro,INRA, Montpellier, France",rutger.de-wit@umontpellier.fr,68,6,6,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",2296-701X,FRONT ECOL EVOL,Front.

Conservation governance, for example, typically occurs at a single scale, but needs to inform governance and action at other scales to be truly effective at achieving social and ecological outcomes. This process is conventionally conceived as unidirectional - either scaling down or scaling up - in the way it both exploits and creates the natural, social, human, institutional, and financial resources and benefits that are collectively known as conservation 'capital'. Here we analyse multiscale conservation governance and the different types of capital that impede or facilitate its effectiveness. Comparative analysis of conservation planning in Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands, through in-depth document review, key informant interview, and participant observation, reveals limited evidence of unidirectional processes. Instead, we observe multidirectional scaling pathways, cultivated by the following six scale-explicit characteristics of effective conservation governance: 1) multiscale understanding, 2) scale jumping, 3) scaled leadership characteristics, 4) scaled stakeholder engagement, 5) scaled policy frameworks, and 6) scaled institutional settings. While the latter four are familiar concepts, though not always recognised as explicitly scalar, we know little about the first two attributes of conservation governance. Based on this novelty and relevance, we propose a new form of capital - 'scalar capital' - to complement natural, social, human, institutional, and financial capitals as both input and outcome of effective conservation governance. We find that scalar capital facilitates flows of different resources (data, conservation objectives, practitioner experience, institutional support, and funding) in multiple directions. Critically, we present empirical evidence that conservation governance can foster scalar capital to improve outcomes across multiple scales.","[Cheok, Jessica; Weeks, Rebecca; Morrison, Tiffany H.; Pressey, Robert L.] James Cook Univ, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld 4814, Australia",jessica.cheok@my.jcu.edu.au,103,1,1,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0959-3780,GLOBAL ENVIRON CHANG,Glob.

Conflicts often impede effective implementation of needed conservation measures and also have implications for social inequality, resource use and economic development. Bivalve molluscan shellfish aquaculture is commonly considered one of the least impactful forms of protein production worldwide but, in some locations, may interfere with essential activities of threatened species such as the stopover ecology of migrating shorebirds. Here we assess the impact of oyster aquaculture as practiced in Delaware Bay (New Jersey, USA) on the presence and foraging behavior of migratory shorebird species of conservation concern. We conducted counts and behavioral observations of shorebirds across a 4.8-km stretch of the Delaware Bay and tested the effect of regulated aquaculture structures and activities on shorebird presence relative to various environmental factors. We also evaluated differences in mean peck rates for each species within and away from aquaculture areas, and we examined multiple factors influencing foraging rates for each species. For all species, we found that oyster tending reduced the probability of shorebird presence by 1-7%, whereas the untended aquaculture structures had no detectable impact. Foraging rates were mostly influenced by environmental conditions, particularly the presence of competitors (gulls or other shorebirds), and the foraging substrate. None of the focal species substantially altered their time budget or foraging rates in the presence of tended or untended oyster aquaculture. This evidence suggests that intertidal oyster aquaculture and migrating shorebirds can co-utilize the resource rich intertidal areas on which they occur.","[Maslo, Brooke; Yuhas, Tanner; Schumm, Brian; Burger, Joanna; Lockwood, Julie L.] Rutgers State Univ, Ecol Evolut & Nat Resources, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA; [Burkhalter, J.

In the case of coral reefs, processes influencing coral community structure occur on time scales of days (recruitment, predation), months (seasonal environmental stress), or years (competition for space). In both marine and terrestrial systems, observing the ecology of remote locations at fine temporal scales is made difficult by the high cost or complexity of resurveying the same location at high frequency. These restrictions have produced limited understanding of in-situ ecological processes which occur at fine temporal scales and influence community structure but are easily missed during infrequent surveys.

Results of a 1-month deployment with twice-daily photo capture are presented.

For this reason, many studies on the social science of resource management and governance seek to quantify biodiversity outcomes. Here, we focus on the International Forestry Resources and Institutions program to demonstrate some of the challenges of quantitative biodiversity assessment and suggest ways to overcome them. One of this program's research goals is to understand the causes of biodiversity loss, which is explicitly assessed using plot-based forest sampling. Plot-based methods to capture biodiversity changes require huge amounts of data. Even if sampling is sufficient, existing protocols can only capture changes in the types of species actually sampled, typically trees. Other elements of biodiversity are not censused, including animals, herbs, shrubs, fungi, and epiphytes that may provide medicine, food, wildlife habitat, trade items, or cultural goods. Using case studies of two sites in Uganda, we demonstrate that more spatially extensive surveys targeting multiple types of data can give a broader picture of forest status and changes than can plot-based sampling alone; many relevant variables can be observed while traveling among plot points with little additional effort. Reviewing the ecological literature, we identify correlates of forest status that can supplement plot-based sampling. These include large trees, epiphyte-laden trees, culturally or commercially valuable species, large stumps, and evidence of hunting and trapping. Further, data elicited from local resource users can play an important role in biodiversity monitoring. These findings suggest that effective biodiversity monitoring may be within easier reach than previously thought, although robust comparisons among sites remains a challenge, especially when climate, soils, or site history differ greatly.","[Salk, Carl F.] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Southern Swedish Forest Res Ctr, Uppsala, Sweden; [Chazdon, Robin] Univ Connecticut, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Storrs, CT USA; [Chazdon, Robin] Univ Sunshine Coast, Trop Forests & People Res Ctr, Sippy Downs, Qld, Australia; [Waiswa, Daniel] Makerere Univ, Dept Geog Geoinformat & Climat Sci, POB 7062, Kampala, Uganda",,67,2,2,RESILIENCE ALLIANCE,WOLFVILLE,"ACADIA UNIV, BIOLOGY DEPT, WOLFVILLE, NS B0P 1X0, CANADA",1708-3087,ECOL SOC,Ecol.

Understanding the influence of human-mediated translocations and habitat constraints on landscape patterns of genetic structure in threatened fish species is essential to maintaining biodiversity and adaptive potential. Objectives We evaluated the degree of influence from supplemental stocking, assessed the spatial population genetic structure, and examined the potential relationship between hybridization and ecology for Brook Trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) in the Black River watershed in New York State, USA. Methods We used 13 microsatellite loci from over 450 fish at 18 sampling locations to map genetic structure and diversity, estimate the level of influence from stocked conspecifics, and model the relationship between hybridization and ecological characteristics. Results We found widespread genetic introgression attributable to state-based stocking activities and a pattern of hierarchical genetic diversity across the landscape, which has additionally been influenced by geography. Site-specific fish assemblage variables appear to be unrelated to introgressive hybridization from stocked conspecifics, and only one hydrochemical variable, SO42-, exhibited strong explanatory power in predicting hybridization between wild and supplemented fish. A single locality exhibited genetic structure consistent with no history of introgression potentially associated with differences in elevation, and thus contributed disproportionately to the level of genetic diversity observed across the landscape. Conclusions When examining genetic structure in fluvial riverine networks, it is important to consider the combined and interacting effects of both hybridization and habitat, which may result in augmented genetic structure not predictable from any single factor.","[Bruce, Spencer A.] SUNY Albany, Dept Biol Sci, Albany, NY 12222 USA; [Bruce, Spencer A.; Wright, Jeremy J.] New York State Museum & Sci Serv, Cultural Educ Ctr 3140, Albany, NY 12230 USA; [George, Scott D.; Baldigo, Barry P.] US Geol Survey, New York Water Sci Ctr, 425 Jordan Rd, Troy, NY 12180 USA",sbruce@albany.edu; sgeorge@usgs.gov; bbaldigo@usgs.gov; Jeremy.Wright@nysed.gov,81,1,1,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-2973,LANDSCAPE ECOL,Landsc.

Dung removal is the most commonly quantified ecological function performed by dung beetles, since it is assumed to be strongly related to many other functions, such as soil excavation, pest control, nutrient cycling, secondary seed dispersal, etc. However, results of some studies suggest that this assumption may not always hold. We carried out a field study in the Brazilian Amazon to address four questions: (1) Does dung removal explain soil excavation and seed dispersal of small, medium and large seeds?; (2) Does soil excavation explain seed dispersal?; (3) Does land-use type affect the relationships between functions?; (4) Do the relationships between dung beetle functions and community attributes help us understand the relationships between functions? We sampled dung beetles and their functions in 58 transects distributed across four land-use types: primary forest, secondary forest, agriculture and pasture. Dung removal did not explain soil excavation or seed dispersal, except the dispersal of small seeds in the primary forest; the latter result indicates that land-use can affect the relationships between functions. The dispersal of small, medium and large seeds was explained by soil excavation, and these relationships were not affected by land-use type. In general, the relationships between functions and community attributes that we assessed had little value in helping us interpret the relationships between functions. Our results indicate that dung removal may not always be a good proxy for other dung-beetle mediated functions; furthermore, the relationship between dung removal and other functions (e.g. small-seed dispersal) can vary depending on environmental conditions (e.g. land-use). When dung beetles are used for conservation monitoring, we recommend that ecological functions of interest be quantified empirically, in addition to dung removal. Studies that have a particular interest in the function of secondary seed dispersal, or other dung-beetle functions associated with bioturbation (e.g. soil aeration), may consider using soil excavation as a proxy variable.","[Carvalho, Raquel L.] Univ Fed Uberlandia, Inst Biol, Uberlandia, MG, Brazil; [Andresen, Ellen] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Invest Ecosistemas & Sustentabilidad, Morelia, Michoacan, Mexico; [Baronio, Gudryan J.] Univ Fed Vales Jequitinhonha & Mucuri, Diamantina, MG, Brazil; [Oliveira, Victor H.

Despite their widespread use, few studies have examined how ecological theory can guide the selection or surrogates and indicators, and thus reduce the likelihood of failure or cost of validation. We argue that ecological niche theory and knowledge of the extent to which particular limiting factors (e.g. physiological tolerances, limits to growth rates, or competitive exclusion) affect species distributions, abundance and coexistence could inform the choice of potential surrogates. Focusing on the environmental characteristics that define species niches makes it possible to identify situations where surrogates are likely to be ineffective, such as when there is no mechanistic basis for a candidate surrogate to be related to a biodiversity target. We describe two case studies where different candidate surrogate variables are shown to have contrasting potential as indicators of sustainable farming. Variables not mechanistically linked to the driver of change or responsive over appropriate timeframes or spatial scales are suggested a priori to be uninformative. The niche concept provides a framework for exploring ecological relationships that can inform the selection or exclusion of potential biodiversity surrogates. We think that this new approach to integrating ecological theory and application could lead to improved effectiveness of biodiversity monitoring and conservation.","[Barton, Philip S.; Westgate, Martin J.; Foster, Claire N.; O'Loughlin, Luke S.; Sato, Chloe F.; Lindenmayer, David B.] Australian Natl Univ, Fenner Sch Environm & Soc, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Cuddington, Kim] Univ Waterloo, Dept Biol, Waterloo, ON, Canada; [Hastings, Alan] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Environm Sci & Policy, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Willig, Michael R.] Univ Connecticut, Ctr Environm Sci & Engn, Storrs, CT 06269 USA; [Willig, Michael R.] Univ Connecticut, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Storrs, CT 06269 USA; [Lindenmayer, David B.] Australian Natl Univ, Sustainable Farms Project, Canberra, ACT, Australia",philip.barton@anu.edu.au,89,4,4,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1470-160X,ECOL INDIC,Ecol.

We reviewed the academic literature to synthesize the motivations, successes, challenges, and lessons from protected and conserved areas led by Indigenous Peoples globally. We found and analyzed 58 papers, describing 86 specific initiatives involving at least 68 Indigenous Peoples across 25 countries. We found that Indigenous Peoples established protected and conserved areas independently and through local- and broad-scale partnerships. States that supported such efforts did so through formal legislation, agreements, and policies, and informally through local relationships and shared values. Indigenous Peoples' protected and conserved areas created socio-cultural, political, and ecological benefits such as improving Indigenous livelihoods, increasing governance and management capacities, and improving species populations and habitat protection. However, some challenges (e.g. restrictive legislations, burdensome partnerships, insufficient funding) limited benefits, and demanded additional capacities and resources for mitigation. We recommend that states and other external actors: create and improve policies, legislations, and resources for Indigenous Peoples' protected and conserved areas as defined by Indigenous Peoples; provide resources and facilitate Indigenous leadership to shape external mechanisms for protected area establishment and development; and create new internal mechanisms for Indigenous engagement and partnerships. Indigenous Peoples would benefit from building partnerships to support and manage their areas. Finally, we suggest that managers commit more resources to effectively monitor and manage these areas, including integrating management priorities with local and larger scale socio-cultural and environmental issues that affect these areas.","[Tran, Tanya C.; Ban, Natalie C.; Bhattacharyya, Jonaki] Univ Victoria, Sch Environm Studies, POB 1700 STN CSC, Victoria, BC V8W 3R4, Canada",tanyatran@uvic.ca; nban@uvic.ca; jonaki.bhattacharyya@gmail.com,73,22,22,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0006-3207,BIOL CONSERV,Biol.

Conservation plans are developed at different levels, defined here as points on a range of spatial extent varying from global to local. However, approaches to integrate plans effectively across levels remain elusive. To plan across multiple levels most effectively, the relative strengths and weaknesses of planning at different levels must be understood. Taking the Coral Triangle region of the western Pacific Ocean as a case study, we apply an adapted social-ecological system (SES) framework to assess the scalar coverage of conservation plans, i.e., the extent to which plans developed at one level adequately consider the social and ecological levels and components (i.e., resource units, resource systems, governance systems, actors) of an SES. No conservation plans we assessed had complete cross-level coverage. Plans most adequately addressed social and ecological components at the same level of planning and, to a lesser extent, lower levels. In line with previous literature suggesting that social factors are most relevant at local levels, we found that local-level plans engaged with the greatest number of stakeholder groups, whereas higher level plans more adequately addressed ecological components. Given that it appears more practicable for higher level plans to consider components at lower levels, the onus should fall on higher level planning to link to lower levels. Achieving complete cross-level coverage will require vertical interactions between planning processes at different levels, and conceiving of planning processes across all levels as connected planning systems. We demonstrate how an adapted SES framework can be used by conservation planners to assess the cross-level coverage of their own plans and to formulate appropriate conservation objectives to address social and ecological components at different levels.","[Cheok, Jessica; Weeks, Rebecca; Pressey, Robert L.] James Cook Univ, Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Australian Res Council, Douglas, Qld 4814, Australia",,93,1,1,RESILIENCE ALLIANCE,WOLFVILLE,"ACADIA UNIV, BIOLOGY DEPT, WOLFVILLE, NS B0P 1X0, CANADA",1708-3087,ECOL SOC,Ecol.

However, MPA performance is likely to be compromised if people who depend on fishing are excluded from MPA design decision making. Participatory MPA design helps to address this problem by engaging local stakeholders in all critical decisions, including the total coverage, placement, and local size of no-take marine reserves. Here, we report the findings from a participatory MPA design project on Selayar Island, Indonesia, in which a community initiated collaborations with scientists to access modern quantitative tools for community-led MPA scenario testing. The outcomes highlight a local disagreement between ecologically and socially desirable MPA designs. Focused on social considerations, the initial community-supported MPA design consisted of four small reserves (0.5-1 km wide) in predominately southern community waters, where they were intended to restrict external fishers. Ecologically optimal MPA designs, in contrast, consisted of one or two large reserves (4-6 km wide) in northern community waters, where they were expected to restrict primarily local fishers but better support the rebuilding of fish populations and fisheries. However, ecologically optimal MPA designs were socially infeasible. Using quantitative MPA performance assessments, the community negotiated an alternative MPA design consisting of two 1.5-2 km wide reserves at socially and ecologically favorable locations. Compared to the initial proposal, this revised MPA design was estimated (1) to protect three to four times more individuals of key fishery species within reserve boundaries and (2) to double local fishery catches. We conclude that even simple MPA design tools, which quantify and visualize local conservation and fishery outcomes under alternative MPA scenarios, add value to participatory decision making and likely MPA performance.","[Krueck, Nils C.; Mumby, Peter J.] Univ Queensland, Sch Biol Sci, St Lucia Campus, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia; [Krueck, Nils C.; Mumby, Peter J.] Univ Queensland, Australian Res Council, Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, St Lucia Campus, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia; [Krueck, Nils C.] Inst Marine & Antarctic Studies, 15-21 Nubeena Crescent, Taroona, Tas 7053, Australia; [Abdurrahim, Ali Yansyah] Indonesian Inst Sci, Res Ctr Populat, Jakarta, Indonesia; [Adhuri, Dedi S.] Indonesian Inst Sci, Res Ctr Soc & Culture, Jakarta, Indonesia; [Ross, Helen] Univ Queensland, Sch Agr & Food Sci, St Lucia Campus, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia",,35,6,6,RESILIENCE ALLIANCE,WOLFVILLE,"ACADIA UNIV, BIOLOGY DEPT, WOLFVILLE, NS B0P 1X0, CANADA",1708-3087,ECOL SOC,Ecol.

PUGS in highly urbanized cities require particular conservation strategies. Here, we propose an approach for PUGS management which integrates three components: (i) scientific knowledge (monitoring/restoration), (ii) community interaction with the environment, and (iii) management decision. Based on the perception of stakeholders, we searched for evidence that these components are well-integrated in PUGS management and decision-making. The intersection of these components should produce a solid management program, provided that the obtained multidisciplinary knowledge meets the needs of information required by the community and decision makers. We tested this in a small PUGS located within Mexico City at the National Autonomous University of Mexico campus that holds the Ecological Reserve of Pedregal de San Angel. Through a participatory approach we elicited mental models and represented group beliefs using Fuzzy Cognitive Mapping (FCM). This, in turn, produced evidence of effective integration of the three components in terms of management and decision-making. Our findings provide insight into the actors' perceptions and concerns and suggest that the interactions among the three components, although important, are not self-generated and must be constructed. The findings also suggest that one of the management problems is the mismatch between scientific knowledge and conservation programs. It is paramount to include generated knowledge into management and monitoring programs. The complexity of the PUGS requires an active collaboration among actors and monitoring the development of management strategies using the three components while taking the conservation goals into account.","[Zambrano, Luis; Fonseca, Alejandra; Ramos, Alejandra G.; Coronel-Arellano, Heli; Negrete-Gonzalez, Marcela] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Biol, Lab Restaurac Ecol, Mexico City, DF, Mexico; [Cano-Santana, Zenon; Bonilla-Rodriguez, Manuel] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Fac Ciencias, Lab Interacc & Proc Ecol, Mexico City, DF, Mexico; [Wegier, Ana; Arroyo-Lambaer, Denise; Perez-Lopez, Javier; Gonzalez Calderon, Brenda] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Biol, Jardh Bot, Lab Genet Conservec, Mexico City, DF, Mexico; [Jaime Zuniga-Vega, J.; Ramirez-Cruz, Gonzalo A.] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Fac Ciencias, Lab Ecol Evolut & Demog Anim, Mexico City, DF, Mexico; [Suarez, Antonio] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Fac Arquitectura, Lab Movilidad & Infraestruct Verde Arquitectura P, Mexico City, DF, Mexico; [Rafael Bouchain, Csar] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Invest Econ, Econ Aplicada, Mexico City, DF, Mexico; [Gual Sill, Fernando] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Fac Ciencias, Etol Fauna Silvestre & Anim Lab, Mexico City, DF, Mexico; [Campo, Julio] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Ecol, Lab Biogeoquim Terrestre & Clima, Mexico City, DF, Mexico; [Ortega-Larrocea, Pilar] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Geol, Lab Microcosmos Bioedaf, Mexico City, DF, Mexico; [Fonseca, Alejandra] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Coordinat Univ Sustentabilidad, Mexico City, DF, Mexico; [Ramos, Alejandra G.] Univ Autonoma Baja California, Fac Ciencias, Ensenada, Baja California, Mexico; [Castillo, Alicia] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Invest Ecosistemas & Sustentabilidad, Lab Sociol & Comunicac, Morelia, Michoacan, Mexico",zambrano@ib.unam.mx,109,2,2,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,FRONT ENV SCI-SWITZ,Front.

We recommend six strategies for strengthening the country's biodiversity conservation, that is, strengthening biodiversity in ES&PA programs, PAs as the core, integrating biodiversity and ecosystem services, delivering effective monitoring, broad inclusiveness of stakeholders and mainstreaming biodiversity.

Though we often see it as a contemporary problem, engineering the interface of science and decision-making bodies has been a question since the founding of ecology. This study traces the creation of new conservation initiatives via the repeated splintering of the Ecological Society of America since the early 1900s and compares these against the results of a network analysis of contemporary scientists and their affiliations. Notwithstanding the new terminology of science-policy interfaces, brokers, and gaps, these questions often hinge on the same dilemmas as they did at the beginning of 20th century. The history of these groups shows how divisive distinctions between ecology and conservation, pure and applied research, science and politics, and facts versus values can quickly become integrated into the structure of organizations-even those that are created specifically to bridge gaps in what today would be called the science-policy interface. Meanwhile, a social network analysis of present-day scientists suggests that individual researchers are finding ways to informally jump across science-policy gaps at a sub-organizational level. Remarkably, these science-policy conflicts can pose major problems for organizations, even when the actual activities of members traverse these boundaries on an individual basis. When designing science policy interfaces, formal bridging mechanisms between organizations remain important but these should also support the ongoing, if under-the-radar, ways that individuals negotiate gaps between conservation research and policy advocacy.","[Nyssa, Zoe] Purdue Univ, Dept Anthropol, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA",znyssa@purdue.edu,46,1,1,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",1462-9011,ENVIRON SCI POLICY,Environ.

Saving nature, to be sure, has never been an easy proposition. But the arrival of the Anthropocene - the alleged new phase of world history in which humans dominate the earth-system seems to have upped the ante dramatically; the choices facing the conservation community have now become particularly stark. Several proposals for revolutionising conservation have been proposed. including 'new' conservation, 'half Earth' and more. These have triggered heated debates and potential for (contemplating) radical change. Here, we argue that these do not take political economic realities seriously enough and hence cannot lead us forward. Another approach to conservation is needed, one that takes seriously our economic system's structural pressures, violent socio-ecological realities, cascading extinctions and increasingly authoritarian politics. We propose an alternative termed 'convivial conservation'. Convivial conservation is a vision, a politics and a set of governance principles that realistically respond to the core pressures of our time. Drawing on a variety of perspectives in social theory and movements from around the globe, it proposes a post-capitalist approach to conservation that promotes radical equity, structural transformation and environmental justice and so contributes to an overarching movement to create a more equal and sustainable world.","[Buscher, Bram; Fletcher, Robert] Wageningen Univ, Sociol Dev & Change, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Buscher, Bram] Univ Johannesburg, Dept Geog Environm Management & Energy Studies, Johannesburg, South Africa; [Buscher, Bram] Stellenbosch Univ, Dept Sociol & Social Anthropol, Stellenbosch, South Africa",bram.buscher@wur.nl,87,52,51,WOLTERS KLUWER MEDKNOW PUBLICATIONS,MUMBAI,"WOLTERS KLUWER INDIA PVT LTD , A-202, 2ND FLR, QUBE, C T S  NO 1498A-2 VILLAGE MAROL, ANDHERI EAST, MUMBAI, 400059, INDIA",0972-4923,CONSERV SOC,Conserv.

Despite being an abundant migrant in Andean forests, the species' elevational distribution and non-breeding ecology have yet to be studied, thereby precluding the design of effective conservation actions. During four non-breeding periods (2012-2016), we surveyed Colombia's three Andean ranges, carrying out passive 5-minute point counts between 700 and 3,150 m asl in five habitats (mature forest, secondary growth, forest edges/riparian forest, shade coffee, sun coffee), recording the perpendicular distance, sex, foraging height, and association with mixed species flocks of Canada Warbler. Habitat variables were recorded at each point. Based on 819 passive point counts, Canada Warblers occupied elevations between 750 and 2,300 m, being more abundant between 1,000 and 2,200 m. Relative densities were higher in mature forest compared to shade coffee and secondary forest, and accordingly abundance increased with canopy height. There was no evidence for a difference in elevation or habitat use by males and females. Within forests, birds foraged at mid-levels, 5-15 m above the ground, and the probability of Canada Warblers occurring in mixed species flocks increased with elevation. Models of variation in relative density throughout the Eastern Andes showed a positive relation with cloud cover and above-ground forest biomass, implying a preference for humid, forested regions. Of the areas in the Eastern Andes with high predicted relative density, similar to 14% overlapped with protected areas and we identify priority areas where protective measures could benefit the conservation status of the species. For maximum effectiveness, conservation actions should focus on protecting forest fragments and initiating reforestation projects at mid-elevations (1,000-2,200 m), as well as supporting agroforestry practices in humid regions of the Colombian Andes.","[Cespedes, Laura N.; Bayly, Nicholas J.] SELVA Invest Conservac Neotrop, Bogota, DC, Colombia; [Cespedes, Laura N.] Univ Los Andes, Lab Biol Evolut Vertebrados, Bogota, Colombia",ln.cespedes508@uniandes.edu.co; nick.bayly@selva.org.co,64,12,12,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0959-2709,BIRD CONSERV INT,Bird Conserv.

Assessments to determine ecological condition should address the specific environmental features of these unique ecosystems, while conservation management requires balancing maintenance of good ecological condition with the ecosystem services provided by LFRs. However, a systematic evaluation of the scientific literature on assessment of ecological condition of LFRs and trade-offs to guide conservation management is currently lacking. Here, we reviewed 153 peer reviewed scientific articles to characterize methodological patterns and trends and identify knowledge gaps in the assessment of LFRs. Our review revealed that most approaches used classical biotic indices for assessing ecological condition of LFRs. However, the number of articles specifically addressing the peculiarities of LFRs was low. Many studies used watershed level surveys and assessed samples from small streams to large rivers using the same methodological protocol. Most studies evaluated the status of main stem river habitats only, indicating large knowledge gaps with respect to the diversity of river-floodplain habitat types or lateral connectivity. Studies related to management were oriented toward specific rehabilitation actions rather than broader conservation of LFRs. Papers relating to ecosystem services of LFRs were especially few. Most importantly, these studies did not distinguish the different functional units of river-floodplain habitat types (e.g. eupotamon, parapotamon) and their role in ecosystem services provision. Overall, the number of articles was too low for meaningful analyses of the relationships and tradeoffs between biodiversity conservation, maintaining ecological condition, and use of ecosystem services in LFRs. Our review highlights research gaps and emphasizes the importance of developing more holistic indicators of ecosystem condition, which better reflect landscape level changes in structure and functioning of LFRs. As human use of water and land increases, the need to develop more effective spatial conservation prioritization tools becomes more important.

In order to alleviate severe soil erosion, China has implemented historically unprecedented large-scale afforestation. In this study, we selected the most severely eroded Loess Plateau as a case, to assess the effectiveness of soil and water conservation (SWC) efforts based on the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation. In addition, the underlying drivers for soil erosion changes and hydrological effects of SWC were investigated, and finally the potential policy implications of our findings were discussed. The soil erosion intensity from 2000 to 2015 was weakened largely due to favorable climate conditions and SWC efforts, which promoted vegetation restoration and enhanced soil retention. However, there was a significant trade-off between water provision and soil retention functions. The excessively artificial afforestation reduced sediment yield but depleted surface runoff. Furthermore, artificial afforestation and increasing irrigation water consumption overused groundwater resources and finally lowered groundwater table. The SWC efforts characterized by artificial afforestation induced soil moisture declining, particularly for the conversion type of farmland to forest/ shrub. Our results suggested that afforestation might be a poor choice in arid and semiarid regions, because it did not consider local precipitation conditions, and have exacerbated water shortages and offset SWC efforts. Therefore, the future ecological restoration efforts should be transformed from simple species-based measures to optimal plant species combinations to minimize the tradeoff between water yield and soil retention. The strategies for ecological restoration of drylands should also account for water balance to ensure effectiveness and sustainability.","[Jiang, Chong] Guangzhou Inst Geog, Guangdong Open Lab Geospatial Informat Technol &, Guangzhou 510070, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Jiang, Chong] Guangzhou Inst Geog, Key Lab Guangdong Utilizat Remote Sensing & Geog, Guangzhou 510070, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Jiang, Chong] Beijing Normal Univ, Coll Global Change & Earth Syst Sci, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Haiyan] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Wang, Xinchi] Southern Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Environm Sci & Engn, Shenzhen 518055, Peoples R China; [Feng, Yuqing] China Univ Geosci Beijing, Sch Water Resources & Environm, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China; [Labzovskii, Lev] Natl Inst Meteorol Sci, Div Climate Res, Seogwipo Si 63568, Jeju Do, South Korea",jiangchong1987@gmail.com,90,45,52,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0925-8574,ECOL ENG,Ecol.

Unfortunately, the records, specimens, and objects historical ecologists need to help generate that understanding are often lacking. And because of a general underinvestrnent by society in systematic collection and museum curation, future historical ecologists may be similarly limited in their ability to investigate conditions regarding our present day. Given the importance of historical data and materials in contemporary conservation decision-making, we suggest it is incumbent upon resource managers and scientists to ask whether additional research efforts are needed to document past and present conditions of the places and resources of their interest. Here, we discuss how such an inquiry was applied to the terrestrial and nearshore environments of Santa Cruz Island, California, USA. The island harbors numerous endemic taxa, important archaeological and fossil sites, and rich cultural significance. It also has undergone dramatic and ongoing alteration due to past and present human activities. We describe an interdisciplinary effort to identify information gaps regarding past and present conditions of the island. In many cases, filling those gaps will require a research focus on a broader geography and suite of resources, including the archipelago in which the island sits and mainland sister sites. An initiative to improve collection and retention of priority information could be a basis of interdisciplinary and multi-institutional collaboration and could be designed to foster environmental education and citizen science programs that engage the next generation of conservationists. An outcome of this initiative would be an archive of materials and data to inform the historical ecologists and conservationists of the future, and to help conservationists today ensure that the resources they deem most important will be stewarded successfully into that future.","[Morrison, Scott A.] Nature Conservancy, 201 Mission St,4th Floor, San Francisco, CA 94105 USA; [Sillett, T.

A species ecological niche determines its geographic distribution, and species distribution models (SDMs) can be used to predict them. For various reasons, e.g., the lack of spatial data on relevant environmental factors, SDMs fail to characterize important ecological relationships. We argue that SDMs do not yet include relevant environmental information, which can be measured with remote sensing (RS). RS may benefit SDMs because it provides information on e.g., ecosystem function, health and structure, complete spatial assessment, and reasonable temporal repeat for the processes that determine geographical distributions. However, RS data is still seldom included in such studies with the exception of climate data. Here we provide a guide for researchers aiming to improve their SDM studies, describing how they might include RS data in their specific study. We propose how to improve models of species ecological niches, by including measures of habitat quality (e.g., productivity), nutritional values, and seasonal or life-cycle events. To date, several studies have shown that using ecologically-relevant environmental predictors derived from RS improve model performance and transferability, and better approximate a species ecological niche. These data, however, are not a panacea for SDMs, as there are cases in which RS predictors are not appropriate, too costly, or exhibit low predictive power. The integration of multiple environmental predictors derived from RS in SDMs can thus improve our knowledge on processes driving biodiversity change and improve our capacity for biodiversity conservation.","[Leitao, Pedro J.] Tech Univ Carolo Wilhelmina Braunschweig, Inst Geoecol, Dept Landscape Ecol & Environm Syst Anal, Braunschweig, Germany; [Leitao, Pedro J.] Humboldt Univ, Geog Dept, Berlin, Germany; [Santos, Maria J.] Univ Zurich, Univ Res Prior Program Global Change & Biodivers, Zurich, Switzerland; [Santos, Maria J.] Univ Zurich, Dept Geog, Zurich, Switzerland",p.leitao@tu-braunschweig.de,74,28,28,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",2296-701X,FRONT ECOL EVOL,Front.

We found that the protocol is well suited to detect moderate (>= 5%) population changes within 3-4 years for relatively common species that have medium to high detection probabilities (i.e. p > 0.2). The TEAM protocol cannot, however, detect typical changes in rare and evasive species, a category into which many tropical species and many species of conservation concern fall.

In this chapter, we highlight current challenges to the Model (and to conservation, generally).

Conventional, centralized approaches to conservation, often featuring unconnected discrete patches', are no longer sufficient for achieving effective, long-term protection. The purpose of this study was to gain a better understanding of how to achieve effective large-scale conservation initiatives by addressing the following objectives: (1) To assess the degree to which local actors are involved in coastal and marine conservation practices, with a focus on large-scale conservation initiatives (LCIs); and, (2) To identify barriers and opportunities for achieving effective large-scale conservation. This paper presents findings from research in the Dominican Republic where social-ecological components of coastal and marine systems are considered from multiple perspectives to advance management and increase effectiveness of LCIs. Data were acquired through semi-structured interviews with 35 coastal and marine actors (e.g. fishers, ministers, non-governmental organizations, practitioners, academics) working at local to international scales. Interview data were analysed through thematic coding using QSR-Nvivo 12 software. Respondents expressed that non-governmental actors (e.g. private organizations, coastal communities) should have an increased role in developing, implementing and managing coastal and marine LCIs. Additionally, respondents commented on strategies to enhance social connectivity (i.e. sharing experiences, programs and expertise) within coastal and marine practices to enhance effectiveness and facilitate learning. Findings contribute to the understanding of complex coastal and marine social-ecological systems of the Dominican Republic and provide further support for involving multiple actors in governance processes.","[Eger, S.] Univ Waterloo, Sch Environm Resources & Sustainabil, Waterloo, ON, Canada; [Doberstein, B.] Univ Waterloo, Geog & Environm Management, Waterloo, ON, Canada",seger@uwaterloo.ca,93,2,2,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1350-4509,INT J SUST DEV WORLD,Int.

Of these, the little bustard, a medium-sized, long-lived, ground nesting bird, has declined by 95% in France over the last 35 years. Here we present the results of a 21 year survey of the nesting ecology of this elusive species, analyzing 157 breeding attempts, the largest data set ever collated for this species. Females had a strong preference for meadows for breeding, yet this habitat only represented 14% overall habitat. Alfalfa alone accounted for 50% of nest locations. However, apart from vegetation type, females did not show any other pattern of habitat selection (vegetation height, nest position within field, field under agri-environmental contract-AES-). In addition, the laying period was extremely extended, spanning almost 3 months. We did not detect any strong effect of crop, date or whether the nesting field was in AES or not, on clutch size, egg size and egg-laying date. However, there were long-term changes in breeding phenology (females breed earlier than 20 years ago), and selection of vegetation between years and within years. Hatching success was very low (about half of the broods were destroyed by farm work), and both fecundity and productivity per female were found to be approximately one third of the values expected for a stable population. Overall, nesting females of Little Bustards select meadows in regard to their availability, but do not show any particular preference within meadows' vegetation structure or height. We show that in such system, meadows act as ecological traps, and furthermore, because females do not appear selective, it is impossible to manage meadows in order to limit this trap. We finally analyze whether the land-sharing AESs can conserve this species in intensive arable systems and conclude that the land sharing may not be sustainable. We discuss our results in light of the alternative of land sparing, and suggest that this is probably a better fit for the conservation of large-bodied bird species given their ecological constraints (large home ranges, presence of semi-natural landscape components and freedom from human interference).","[Bretagnolle, Vincent; Denonfoux, Leopold; Villers, Alexandre] CNRS, Ctr Etud Biol Chize, UMR 7372, F-79360 Beauvoir Sur Niort, France; [Bretagnolle, Vincent; Denonfoux, Leopold; Villers, Alexandre] Univ Rochelle, F-79360 Beauvoir Sur Niort, France; [Bretagnolle, Vincent] CNRS, LTSER Zone Atelier Plaine & Val de Sevre, F-79360 Villers En Bois, France",breta@cebc.cnrs.fr,64,5,6,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0006-3207,BIOL CONSERV,Biol.

Asian populations of the Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx), one of the most widespread felids worldwide, are such a case in point. We investigated the diet of Eurasian lynx from feces collected Mediterranean, mixed forest-steppe, and subalpine ecosystems of Turkey. We studied prey preferences and functional responses using prey densities obtained from Random Encounter Modelling. Our analysis revealed that the main prey was brown hare (Lepus europaeus) in all three areas (78%-99% of biomass consumed) and lynx showed a strong preference for brown hare (Chesson's selectivity index, =0.90-0.99). Cannibalism contributed at least 5% in two study areas. The type II functional response of lynx populations in Turkey was similar to the Canada lynx (Lynx canadensis) and daily food intake in grams per lynx matched that of Canada lynx and Iberian lynx (Lynx pardinus), both lagomorph specialists, rather than those of Eurasian lynx from Europe. Therefore, lynx in Turkey may be better described as a lagomorph specialist even though it coexists with ungulate prey. We suggest that ungulate-based foraging ecology of Eurasian lynx in Europe may be a recent adjustment to the availability of high densities of ungulates and cannot be representative for other regions like Turkey. The status of lagomorphs should become an essential component of conservation activities targeted at Eurasian lynx or when using this species as a flagship species for landscape preservation.","[Menguellueoglu, Deniz; Berger, Anne] Leibniz Inst Zoo & Wildlife Res IZW, Dept Evolutionary Ecol, Berlin, Germany; [Ambarli, Huseyin] Duzce Univ, Dept Wildlife Ecol & Management, Fac Forestry, Duzce, Turkey; [Hofer, Heribert] Leibniz Inst Zoo & Wildlife Res, Dept Ecol Dynam, Berlin, Germany; [Hofer, Heribert] Free Univ Berlin, Dept Vet Med, Berlin, Germany; [Hofer, Heribert] Free Univ Berlin, Dept Biol, Chem, Pharm, Berlin, Germany",huseyinambarli@gmail.com,64,18,19,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

The ecosystem-based planning and management approach has developed over the past decades with the goal of reducing this threat by defining planning and management of uses in a way that mitigates negative effects on ecosystem structure and function. For oceans and coasts, marine spatial planning (MSP) can further aid the implementation of ecosystem based management, a widely accepted tenet of planning for the marine environment. It can do so by allocating different uses of space in a way that reduces conflicts for the benefit of the environment. Here, we propose an approach to MSP that incorporates principles of reconciliation ecology for the planning of marine (nearshore) enclosures. The approach supports conservation within and around anthropogenic elements outside of marine protected areas. Since human activity typically involves some damage to natural ecosystem, this research contributes by proposing a way to incorporate ecosystem modeling for MSP that includes human activity. Examining areas of human activity under different management scenarios allows identification of possible trends in human-natural ecosystem interactions. Using such an approach increases marine conservation opportunities, and directs educated and cautious MSP in ways that allow implementation of an ecosystem-based approach.","[Shabtay, Ateret; Portman, Michelle E.] Technion, Fac Architecture & Town Planning, Sego Bldg, IL-32000 Haifa, Israel; [Carmel, Yohay] Technion, Fac Civil & Environm Engn, Haifa, Israel",ateretshabtay@gmail.com,63,3,3,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0925-8574,ECOL ENG,Ecol.

In the British Isles, L. juvernica is absent from Great Britain, but is widespread in Ireland, where it has experienced recent declines; it is classed as a priority species in Northern Ireland. Using a mark-recapture approach, this study aims to elucidate the population and spatial ecology of L. juvernica based on a population resident on a small, suburban site and to propose conservation measures. The results demonstrated that populations of L. juvernica, even on small sites, can reach high numbers during the peak flight season. Unusually for European Pieridae, there was only weak evidence of protandry in this population, possibly reflecting weather conditions prior to the flight season. The spatial distribution and abundance of L. juvernica was associated with the distribution of its larval host-plants, as well as maintaining close proximity to south-facing habitat edges for shelter. Males had a closer association to sheltered habitat edges, whilst females were found more commonly on open ground with a shorter sward which was the preferred egg-laying habitat. Long vegetation in sheltered areas was important for roosting during periods of non-activity. These results inform conservation measures which will benefit L. juvernica; appropriate measures focus on habitat management providing a mosaic of open, semi-natural grassland interspersed with tall vegetation, scrub, and trees.","[O'Neill, James; Montgomery, Ian] Queens Univ Belfast, Sch Biol Sci, Inst Global Food Secur, Belfast BT9 7BL, Antrim, North Ireland",oneill_james@hotmail.co.uk; i.montgomery@qub.ac.uk,37,2,2,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1366-638X,J INSECT CONSERV,J.

We used Q methodology to explore and understand how different conservation practitioners (social and natural science researchers, environmental non-Governmental organisations and decision-makers) in nine European countries argue for conservation. We found that there was a plurality of views about biodiversity and its conservation. A moral argument and some arguments around the intrinsic and ecological value of biodiversity were held by all stakeholder groups. They also shared the view that species valuation does not justify the destruction of nature. However, there were also some differences within and between the groups, which primarily reflected the espousal of either ecocentric or anthropocentric viewpoints.

Previous studies have analysed the effectiveness of market based instruments on single or multiple but independent species. On the example of tradable land-use permits we address an important issue for the first time: the conservation of interacting species (metacommunities). We consider two competing species where the superior competitor locally replaces the inferior competitor. Both species are structured as metapopulations, i.e. can go locally extinct while empty habitats can be recolonised by local populations on neighbouring habitats. Combining a spatially explicit and dynamic ecological-economic simulation model with cluster analysis we investigate how the coexistence of both species depends on the design of the tradable permit scheme, and how the effective scheme design (i.e. the scheme design that maximises coexistence) depends on the biological characteristics of the two species. We show that scheme designs that are effective for the conservation of single species may be ineffective for the conservation of two competing species and that the effectiveness of a scheme with regard to coexistence strongly depends on the relative performances of the two species with regard to their colonisation abilities and local extinction risks.","[Surun, Clement; Drechsler, Martin] UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Ecol Modelling, Permoserstr 15, D-04318 Leipzig, Germany; [Surun, Clement] AgroParisTech, Campus Nancy,16 Rue Girardet, F-54000 Nancy, France",martin.drechsler@ufz.de,30,3,3,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-8009,ECOL ECON,Ecol.

Beech timber stored in the vicinity of the forest can act as an ecological trap for the Rosalia longicorn (Rosalia alpina), so in this study we have attempted to determine the spatial range of the impact of a network of timber stacks. Timber stacks in the species' range in the study area were listed and monitored during the adult emergence period in 2014-2016. Based on published data relating to the species' dispersal capabilities, buffers of four radii (500, 1000, 1600, 3000 m) were delineated around the stacks and the calculated ranges of potential impact. The results show that the percentage of currently known localities of the Rosalia longicorn impacted by stacks varies from 19.7 to 81.6%, depending on the assumed impact radius. The percentage of forest influenced by timber stacks was 77% for the largest-radius buffer. The overall impact of the ecological trap network is accelerated by fragmentation of the impact-free area. It was also found that forests situated close to the timber stacks where the Rosalia longicorn was recorded were older and more homogeneous in age and species composition than those around stacks where the species was absent. Such results suggest that timber stacks act as an ecological trap in the source area of the local population.","[Adamski, Pawel] Polish Acad Sci, Inst Nat Conservat, Al Mickiewicza 33, PL-31120 Krakow, Poland; [Michalcewicz, Jakub] Univ Agr, Inst Forest Ecosyst Protect, Al 29 Listopada 46, PL-31425 Krakow, Poland; [Bohdan, Adam] Fundacja Dzika Polska, Teremiski 12, PL-17230 Bialowieza, Poland; [Ciach, Michal] Univ Agr, Fac Forestry, Inst Forest Ecol & Silviculture, Dept Forest Biodivers, Al 29 Listopada 46, PL-31425 Krakow, Poland",adamski@iop.krakow.pl; j.michalcewicz@ur.krakow.pl; adam.bohdan@wp.pl; michal.ciach@ur.krakow.pl,88,0,0,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1366-638X,J INSECT CONSERV,J.

Numbers of contacts and numbers of adult individuals per contact of the species along transects revealed through negative binomial model that even though the species is present in all climatic zones, it does not show preference to a particular zone, but it is more frequent in mosaics of croplands and fallows (MCF) and in areas at less than 500 m to river. Analyses of floristic composition, suggested that V. doniana occurs globally in different woody plant communities regarding climatic zones, land cover types and distance to the closest river. Significant interaction effects of climatic zone and land cover type were noted on structural parameters (mean diameter and basal area) of V. doniana with the highest values in the Sudanian MCF (46.11 +/- 23.83 cm and 3.35 +/- 3.07 m(2) ha(-1). Moreover, diameter structures revealed globally a predominance of relatively young individuals (dbh <= 20 cm) of the species.

Characterized by stable, adjacent ranges, without any intervening physical barriers, and limited, if any, range overlap in a narrow contact zone, parapatric species are an interesting system for studying biogeographic boundaries. The geographic ranges of two parapatric frog species, Feirana quadranus and F. taihangnica, meet in a contact zone within the Qinling Mountains, an important watershed for East Asia. To identify possible ecological determinants of the parapatric range boundaries for two closely related frog species, we quantified the extent of their niche differentiation in both geographical and environmental space combining ecological niche models with an ordination technique. We tested two alternative null hypotheses (sharp environmental gradients versus a ribbon of unsuitable habitat dividing two highly suitable regions) for biogeographic boundaries, against the null expectation that environmental variation across a given boundary is no greater than expected by chance. Results: We found that the niches of these two parapatric species are more similar than expected by chance, but not equivalent. No sharp environmental gradient was found, while a ribbon of unsuitable habitat did act as a barrier for F. quadranus, but not for F. taihangnica. Conclusions: Integrating our findings with historical biogeographic information, our results suggest that at a contact zone, environmental tolerance restricted F. quadranus from dispersing further north, while interspecific competition most likely prevented the southward expansion of F. taihangnica. This study highlights the importance of both climate and competition in exploring ecological explanations for parapatric range boundaries between ecologically similar frog species, in particular under the effects of changing climate.","[Hu, Junhua] China West Normal Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab Southwest China Wildlife Resource Conserv, Nanchong 637009, Peoples R China; [Hu, Junhua; Jiang, Jianping] Chinese Acad Sci, Chengdu Inst Biol, Chengdu 610041, Peoples R China",hujh@cib.ac.cn,52,17,17,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",,BMC ECOL,BMC Ecol.,2018,"gold, Green Published",

This definition does not exclude land and resource use by local communities who depend on such areas for subsistence and bio-cultural connections. Wilderness areas are important for biodiversity conservation and sustain key ecological processes and ecosystem services that underpin planetary life-support systems. Despite these widely recognized benefits and values of wilderness, they are insufficiently protected and are consequently being rapidly eroded. There are increasing calls for multilateral environmental agreements to make a greater and more systematic contribution to wilderness conservation before it is too late. We created a global map of remaining terrestrial wilderness following the established last-of-the-wild method, which identifies the 10% of areas with the lowest human pressure within each of Earth's 62 biogeographic realms and identifies the 10 largest contiguous areas and all contiguous areas > 10,000 km(2). We used our map to assess wilderness coverage by the World Heritage Convention and to identify gaps in coverage. We then identified large nationally designated protected areas with good wilderness coverage within these gaps. One-quarter of natural and mixed (i.e., sites of both natural and cultural value) World Heritage Sites (WHS) contained wilderness (total of 545,307 km2), which is approximately 1.8% of the world's wilderness extent. Many WHS had excellent wilderness coverage, for example, the Okavango Delta in Botswana (11,914 km(2)) and the Central Suriname Nature Reserve (16,029 km(2)). However, 22 (35%) of the world's terrestrial biorealms had no wilderness representation within WHS. We identified 840 protected areas of > 500 km(2) that were predominantly wilderness (> 50% of their area) and represented 18 of the 22 missing biorealms. These areas offer a starting point for assessing the potential for the designation of new WHSs that could help increase wilderness representation on the World Heritage list. We urge the World Heritage Convention to ensure that the ecological integrity and outstanding universal value of existing WHS with wilderness values are preserved.","[Allan, James R.; Watson, James E.

Situated at this disciplinary meeting point, private land conservation invites a great breadth of approaches and cross-disciplinary work that offer deep insights into social and environmental change, often from surprising angles.

Understanding their dynamic nature is essential for appropriate decisions. However, most often, economic value quantification has received major emphasis whereas ecological values are mostly overlooked, especially in developing countries. With the aim of quantifying ecological values of land use via criteria-based farmer's assessments and empirically analyzed soil properties, three land use types [conservation tillage-based agroforestry land (CTAFL), conventional tillage based cultivated land (CVTCL) and enclosure-based communal land (ECL)] were selected. Criteria-based scoring was used and 90 farmers participated. For soil analysis, sample collection was done following sampling procedures. The results show that farmers have higher preference for CTAFL followed by ECL and CVTCL. This was due to higher ecological values derived from the CTAFL throughout the year with minimum variation compared to CVTCL and ECL. Almost all measured soil variables exhibited significant variation (p < 0.001) among land use type. Almost all soil variables exhibited higher mean values for CTAFL and this supported the results of the farmers' assessments. All ecological value improvements observed for CTAFL were related to clay fractions coupled with the SOC content and degree of soil disturbance.

The objective of this paper is to discuss the various meanings of stewardship in the fields of environmental science and biodiversity conservation. Our main interest is to explore how different political ideologies and ethical values of stewardship shape the conceptualisation of conservation actions and policies, and why do these matter for conservation policy in the context of the new conservation debate. To address this objective we adapted the political science framework developed by Dryzek (2013) and applied it to existing stewardship approaches in use. Based on two dimensions (reformist vs radical and imaginative vs prosaic) we identified 4 main types of stewardship: reformist, adaptive, sustainability and trans formative stewardship. The key distinctions between stewardship types are (i) the role of science, (ii) the exploration and integration of the plurality of values, and (iii) the capacity to modify values, rules and decision making system.

The RESEX program aims to bring traditionally marginalized populations with natural resource dependent livelihoods into national development processes by empowering them to participate in governance and steward biodiversity conservation. We apply the social-ecological systems framework (SESF) and collective action theory to diagnose challenges for comanagement in the Caete-Teperacu marine RESEX near Braganca, Brazil, a multiuse mangrove estuary supporting a small-scale crab fishery. We conducted key informant interviews and build on over 20 years of research in the region to provide an overarching analysis of the challenges facing comanagement. We describe the variables from the SESF in the case context and find that many social and ecological variables interact in clusters over time, and these clusters can be identified as themes, including (1) social and political momentum supporting the RESEX; (2) shifting perceptions of local residents and fishers; (3) patron-client relationships and social-ecological traps; (4) challenges with institutional fit; and (5) the interactions between harvesting closures, compensation, and dependence on local natural resources. Furthermore, we use collective action theory to help explain the role that each variable plays in either hindering or enabling successful governance. Our findings suggest that institutional resilience is needed to make RESEX adaptive to shifting social and political momenta. It could do this by providing more platforms for communication, deliberation, and knowledge exchange among the relevant actors. We believe our findings reflect broader challenges facing RESEX implementation throughout Brazil, and lessons can be learned for MPAs facing difficulties with the implementation of comanagement worldwide.","[Partelow, Stefan; Glaser, Marion; Arce, Sofia Solano; Schlueter, Achim] Leibniz Ctr Trop Marine Res ZMT, Bremen, Germany; [Partelow, Stefan; Schlueter, Achim] Jacobs Univ, Bremen, Germany; [Glaser, Marion] Univ Bremen, Bremen, Germany; [Arce, Sofia Solano] Univ Costa Rica, San Jose, Costa Rica; [Barboza, Roberta Sa Leitao] Univ Fed Para UFPA, ESAC Grp Estudos Socioambientais Costeiros, Campus Braganca, Braganca, Para, Brazil",,116,18,19,RESILIENCE ALLIANCE,WOLFVILLE,"ACADIA UNIV, BIOLOGY DEPT, WOLFVILLE, NS B0P 1X0, CANADA",1708-3087,ECOL SOC,Ecol.

In deserts, freshwater environments constitute threatened local hotspots of biodiversity. In these environments, stable isotopes may help to describe trophic ecology of top-predators. We examined stable carbon (delta C-13) and nitrogen (delta N-15) isotopes from scute keratin samples of 33 Crocodylus suchus and muscle samples from 39 potential prey collected in Southern Mauritania. Isotope ratios were compared among crocodiles according to size (non-adult and adult), and habitat (rock pools and floodplains). There was a significant interaction effect of habitat and size on crocodile delta C-13 values. Whereas delta C-13 was similar for all crocodiles collected in rock pools, adults had lower signatures than non-adults in seasonal floodplains. delta N-15 indicated an ontogenetic dietary shift with adult crocodiles foraging on prey from higher trophic level. Standard ellipse areas showed wider isotopic niches for adult than non-adult crocodiles, and within adults, for those from floodplains than those from rock pools.

For this reason, various nature conservation measures for the promotion of insects are being created in agricultural landscapes. One of those measures is the so-called flower strip at the edge of fields. However, it is repeatedly propagated in the nature conservation community that by means of annually mulched flower strips, species richness and abundance of pollinators in intensively used agricultural areas cannot be increased. Furthermore, these measures might represent ecological traps. To check this criticism, we surveyed one to three meter wide perennial wild flower strips in intensively used agricultural areas, which have been mulched annually for three years, upon abundance, species numbers and biomass of bees and butterflies. By means of transect surveys, species richness and abundance were recorded and biomass was calculated. We compared the findings with those of reference field margins. Our results show an increase in species richness and abundance as well as a general increase in biomass of wild bees and butterflies in wild flower strips compared to findings in the reference field margins. Implications for insect conservation Our study shows that small, annually mulched wild flower strips are able to promote biodiversity of wild bees and butterflies in the intensively used agricultural landscape. Further, our results obtained that this measure does not inevitably represent an ecological trap or sink habitat for most species.","[Schmied, Heiko; Getrost, Larissa; Maassen, Genevieve; Gerhard, Lisa] Fdn Rhenish Cultural Landscape, Rochusstr 18, D-53123 Bonn, Germany; [Schmied, Heiko] Univ Bonn, Inst Crop Sci & Resource Conservat, Agroecol & Organ Farming Grp, Hugel 6, D-53121 Bonn, Germany; [Diestelhorst, Olaf] Bur Diestelhorst, Senefelderweg 32, D-40591 Dusseldorf, Germany",h.schmied@rheinische-kulturlandschaft.de,65,0,0,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1366-638X,J INSECT CONSERV,J.

The wood turtle (Glyptemys insculpta) is a declining North American freshwater turtle that is now listed as threatened or endangered in several US states and Canadian provinces. Local-scale knowledge of wood turtle movement patterns and home range sizes is needed for more effective management and regulatory protection, yet the spatial ecology of this species remains undescribed in large portions of its range. We radiotracked 31 wood turtles for 1-5 yrs each in a stream system along the border of New York and Connecticut to describe their movement behavior and inform management efforts in this previously unstudied region. Annual and multiyear 95% minimum convex polygon home range sizes averaged 2.8 (+/- 3.79 SD) ha and 5.2 (+/- 7.36 SD) ha, respectively. Males had significantly larger annual and multiyear home ranges than did females, often by severalfold. Overlap of home ranges from one year to the next ranged from 10.5% to 99.7% and averaged 62.6% (+/- 22.86% SD). Home range centroids shifted 3.8-328.1 m ((x) over bar = 70.3 +/- 80.31 m SD) from year to year and averaged 41.2 m (+/- 40.56 m SD) from the stream and 138.4 m (+/- 70.66 m SD) from the nearest road across all individuals. Most turtles' home ranges spanned one or both of the major roads in our study area, illuminating the threat of vehicle collision mortality to the viability of this population. Hibernaculum fidelity was low, with only 15% of turtles hibernating in the same location as in the previous year. Our results suggest that management efforts for wood turtles in western Connecticut and the adjacent region of New York should consider that males (the wider-ranging sex) use an average of 5.3 ha to meet their resource requirements over the course of one annual cycle, buffers of at least 116 m surrounding streams should be protected, habitats that are distant from roads should be prioritized for conservation, and measures that facilitate safe passage beneath roads should be implemented whenever roads are present near occupied wood turtle habitat.","[Hagani, Jason S.] Columbia Univ, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, 557 Schermerhorn Hall Extens, New York, NY 10027 USA; [MaCey, Suzanne K.] Amer Museum Nat Hist, Ctr Biodivers & Conservat, 200 Cent Pk West, New York, NY 10024 USA; [MaCey, Suzanne K.] Colutnbia Univ, Ecol Evolut & Environm Biol Dept, 1200 Amsterdam Ave, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Foley, John D.; Seewagen, Chad L.] Great Hollow Nat Preserve & Ecol Res Ctr, 225 CT 37, New Fairfield, CT 06812 USA; [Seewagen, Chad L.] Univ Connecticut, Dept Nat Resources & Environm, 1376 Storrs Rd, Storrs, CT 06269 USA; [Seewagen, Chad L.] Univ Connecticut, Willdlife & Fisheries Conservat Ctr, 1376 Storrs Rd, Storrs, CT 06269 USA",jsh2207@columbia.edu; smacey@amnh.org; jfoley@greathollow.org; cseewagen@greathollow.org,44,0,0,ALLEN PRESS INC,LAWRENCE,"810 E 10TH ST, LAWRENCE, KS 66044 USA",1071-8443,CHELONIAN CONSERV BI,Chelonian Conserv.

Integrating dietary information from live-captured and dead-stranded turtles from the same area can also shed light on their ecological diversity. Here, diet intake and prey diversity are determined for juvenile green turtles Chelonia mydas from a mixed stock foraging aggregation in the Southwestern Atlantic Ocean (SWAO) using stable carbon (delta C-13) and nitrogen (delta N-15) isotope analysis. Skin samples were collected from 117 live-captured (LC) turtles and 66 dead-stranded (DS) individuals along the Parana coast, southern Brazil. Bayesian isotope ellipse space was determined using the program SIBER. A larger isotopic niche space was found among DS turtles, probably because it included long-term resident turtles and recently settled individuals, the latter of which presented low delta N-15 values compared to larger putative local turtles. The Bayesian stable isotope mixing model MixSIAR was used to determine dietary contributions, using isotopic values of putative prey. MixSIAR results indicated invertebrates and macroalgae as primary prey groups, showing the omnivorous strategy of green turtles in the SWAO. Moreover, many of the smallest DS turtles had delta N-15 values suggestive of seagrass consumption, which may reflect individual- and/or life-stage-based diet variability. These findings underscore the value of integrating stranding monitoring protocols with research on live green turtles to evaluate habitat use and diet intake assembled in a neritic foraging area. The data also further knowledge about green turtle foraging ecology and are relevant for species and habitat conservation throughout the SWAO.","[Gama, Luciana R.; Domit, Camila] Univ Fed Parana, Marine Studies Ctr, Lab Ecol & Conservacao, BR-83255000 Pontal Do Parana, Parana, Brazil; [Fuentes, Mariana M.

Consequently, it is critical to adopt conservation approaches that safeguard individual populations while retaining connectivity among these populations. Conserving spatially structured populations of imperiled species at large scales is often complex; and the past decades have therefore seen a rise in spatial conservation prioritization exercises aimed at shaping landscape-scale conservation programmes. We present a framework for informing nationwide connectivity conservation, linking ecological and administrative scales, to maximize relevance for management. We assessed connectivity of the endangered dhole Cuon alpinus among 155 potential source populations across India using a data-driven approach combined with graph and circuit theory. We used clustering algorithms to identify ecologically meaningful conservation landscapes; within each landscape, we identified priority source populations based on their connectedness and quantified pixel-specific habitat accessibility. We superimposed administrative boundaries on our findings to provide conservation recommendations at this management-relevant scale. We first mapped potential dhole movement across India. Dhole populations fell within three primary clusters-Western and Eastern Ghats (WEG), Central Indian Landscape (CIL) and North-East India (NEI)-of which NEI had the highest forest cover, most diffuse connectivity and lowest human density, while WEG had the highest protected area coverage and overall connectedness. Within each conservation landscape, we evaluated the relative importance of Protected Areas and accessibility to high-quality patches. Parts of the Eastern Ghats had low habitat accessibility, yet high potential for dhole landscape connectivity. In 114 identified administrative units of priority for habitat restoration, we highlight those with low accessibility, that is, areas where restoration needs to be spatially targeted for maximum benefits. Synthesis and applications. We make recommendations for spatially informed habitat restoration to enhance dhole connectivity in India, highlighting the importance of improving matrix permeability where dhole movement is currently restricted. More broadly, the framework we present is useful across species and management contexts, as it combines spatial and administrative scales to make ecologically informed assessments of high relevance to management. Synergistically integrating species ecology, threats and administrative considerations in connectivity conservation plans can enhance success of species conservation programmes.","[Rodrigues, Ryan G.; Srivathsa, Arjun] Wildlife Conservat Soc India, Bengaluru, India; [Rodrigues, Ryan G.] Natl Ctr Biol Sci, TIFR, Bengaluru, India; [Srivathsa, Arjun] Univ Florida, Sch Nat Resources & Environm, Gainesville, FL USA; [Srivathsa, Arjun] Univ Florida, Dept Wildlife Ecol & Conservat, Gainesville, FL USA; [Vasudev, Divya] Conservat Initiat, Gauhati, India; [Vasudev, Divya] Ctr Wildlife Studies, Bengaluru, India",ryan@wcsindia.org,84,1,1,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8901,J APPL ECOL,J.

Therefore, a total of 51 Griffon Vultures (Gyps fulvus) from both the re-introduced population and the autochthonous Balkan Peninsula (Balkans) colonies have been tagged with GPS/GSM transmitters in recent years, in order to study their seasonal and spatial distribution. The current study presents the analysis of the high-resolution GPS location data, acquired between January 2016 and March 2021. A total of 1,138,383 locations (an average number of 23,716 +/- 18,886 positions per bird, ranged between 2,515 and 76,431 of total fixes per bird; n=48) were used to estimate the home range size and identify the traditional foraging areas and roosting sites of the birds during the wintering, migration/roaming and summering periods. Our results reveal that Griffon Vultures movement activity and home range size varied considerably throughout the annual cycle, especially between their wintering and summering grounds, while exhibiting significant overlapping amongst the tracked individuals. Specifically, immature Griffon Vultures travel long distances across all Balkan Peninsula countries, but always gather with conspecifics, showing strong fidelity to active breeding/roosting sites. The total home range 95% area of the Griffon Vulture population on the Balkans was estimated at 39,986.4 km(2) and the 50% core area at 1,545.42 km(2) (n = 48). All tracked birds were found to either visit or frequently use (> 95% of the time) the same seven vulture key zones on the Balkan Peninsula - one in Serbia, one shared between North Macedonia and Bulgaria, one shared between Bulgaria and Greece, two entirely lying in Bulgaria, one in western Greece and one shared between Kvarner Archipelago islands in Croatia and the Julian Alps - Italy, Austria and Slovenia. Several smaller sub-zones were also defined within these general ones. The seven key zones form a coherent network and are used as stepping stones for Griffon Vultures during their migration movements and roaming, but also wintering and summering. The observed concentration tendency of Griffon Vultures on the Balkans and the predictability of their temporal and spatial presence should be used to precisely target, address and substantially increase the efficiency of the conservation measures in this marginal and, thus, still vulnerable meta-population.","[Peshev, Hristo; Bonchev, Lachezar; Stoynov, Emilian] Fund Wild Flora & Fauna, 49 Ivan Mihaylov Str,Off 327,POB 78, Blagoevgrad, Bulgaria; [Peshev, Hristo] South West Univ Neofit Rilski, Fac Math & Nat Sci, Dept Geog Ecol & Environm Protect, Blagoevgrad, Bulgaria; [Grozdanov, Atanas] Sofia Univ St Kliment Ohridski, Fac Biol, Dept Zool & Anthropol, 8 Dragan Tsankov Blvd, Sofia, Bulgaria; [Kmetova-Biro, Elena; Ivanov, Ivelin; Marin, Simeon] Green Balkans, 9 Stara Planina Str, Stara Zagora, Bulgaria; [Kmetova-Biro, Elena] Cent European Univ, Dept Environm Sci & Policy, Vienna, Austria; [Kmetova-Biro, Elena] Austrian Ornithol Cent, Vienna, Austria; [Stoyanov, Georgi] Birds Prey Protect Soc, Sofia, Bulgaria; [Tsiakiris, Rigas] Minist Environm & Energy, Forestry Serv Ioannina, Ioaninna, Greece; [Marinkovic, Sasa] Univ Belgrade, Dept Ecol, Inst Biol Res Sinisa Stankovic, Natl Inst Republ Serbia, Bulevar Despota Stefana 142, Belgrade 11060, Serbia; [Susic, Goran] Croatian Acad Sci & Arts, Ornithol Stn Rijeka, Rijeka, Croatia; [Lisichanets, Emanuel] Nat Conservat Assoc AQUILA, Kavadarci, North Macedonia; [Hribsek, Irena] Nat Hist Museum Belgrade, Njegoseva 51, Belgrade, Serbia; [Hribsek, Irena; Karic, Zoran] Birds Prey Protect Fdn, Bulevar Despota Stefana 142, Belgrade, Serbia; [Kapelj, Sven] Assoc BIOM, Zagreb, Croatia",hristopeshev.eu@gmail.com; zootribe@gmail.com; pirin@fwff.org,42,2,3,PENSOFT PUBLISHERS,SOFIA,"12 PROF GEORGI ZLATARSKI ST, SOFIA, 1700, BULGARIA",1314-2836,BIODIVERS DATA J,Biodiver.

The restoration-friendly cultivation model, i.e. planting targeted species in natural settings, is considered a new conservation tool for these epiphytic medicinal orchids, especially for Dendrobium species. In this study, we set out to develop an easy-to-use solution for practice of restoration-friendly cultivation in D. officinale, an critically endangered orchid with high medicinal value. We isolated fungi both from naturally occurred protocorms and roots of adult plants, and successfully obtained nine orchid mycorrhizal fungi (OMFs). Among them, five OMFs have been experimentally tested to promote seed germination and seedling development, but varied greatly in effectiveness. The most effective fungus, Sebacinales LQ, could quickly promote seedling formation and development in D. officinale. The percentage of protocorm formation could reach 65.90 +/- 5.1%, and 4.57 +/- 1.3% of seeds developed into seedlings at 30 days after incubation. At 60 days after incubation, the protocorm formation (83.71 +/- 2.9%) already reached culmination and the percentage of seedlings (68.19 +/- 3.8%) approached to peak level in LQ treatment. The fungus-seed bags, containing mixtures of fungal powders of LQ strains and seeds of D. officinale, were used as propagules and released in the original habitats of D. officinale. After one year, the percentages of seedlings in fungus-seed bags ranged from 13.16 +/- 1.1% up to 20.88 +/- 2.2% at three sites, and most seedlings appeared seemingly healthy. The fungus-seed bags showed many advantages in practice, e.g., low-cost mass production, long term storage, convenient transportation, controllable seedling quantity and density, ease of use in the field, and environmentally-friendly biodegradable paper bags. This low-cost and easy-to-use method could well achieve the target of restoration-friendly cultivation in D. officinale, and has universal applications for conservation translocations of epiphytic orchid based on symbiotic seeds germination.","[Wang, Xin-Ju; Wu, Yi-Hua; Gao, Jiang-Yun] Yunnan Univ, Yunnan Key Lab Plant Reprod Adaptat & Evolutionar, Kunming 650500, Yunnan, Peoples R China; [Wang, Xin-Ju; Wu, Yi-Hua; Gao, Jiang-Yun] Yunnan Univ, Sch Ecol & Environm Sci, Kunming 650500, Yunnan, Peoples R China; [Ming, Xing-Jia] Chongqing Acad Chinese Mat Med, Chongqing Key Lab Tradit Chinese Med Resource, Chongqing 400065, Peoples R China; [Wang, Gang] Chongqing Luohu Agr Dev Co Ltd, Chongqing 404038, Peoples R China",Jiangyun.gao@ynu.edu.cn,84,0,0,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2351-9894,GLOB ECOL CONSERV,Glob.

Southern gelada (Theropithecus gelada obscurus) is an endemic little-known subspecies of gelada that inhabits human-modified landscapes in the northern central highlands of Ethiopia. During an 18-month period, we conducted this intensive study in an unprotected area of a human-modified landscape at Kosheme in Wollo to investigate the feeding ecology of southern geladas and their dietary responses to seasonal variations. We quantified the monthly and seasonal diet data from a band of southern geladas using instantaneous scan sampling method at 15-min intervals, and green grass phenology and availability using visual inspection from the randomly selected permanent plots. The overall average diet of southern geladas at Kosheme constituted grass blades 55.4%, grass undergrounds 13.2%, grass bulbs 5.6%, grass seeds 5.4%, herb leaves 4.0, fruits 7.3%, and cereal crops 5.6%. Grass blade consumption increased with increasing green grass availability, while underground food consumption increased with decreasing green grass availability, and vice versa. Southern geladas spent significantly more time feeding on the grass blades and herb leaves and significantly less time on bulbs during the wet season than the dry season. Underground grass items (rhizomes and corms) were not consumed during the wet season, but made up 22.3% of the dry season diet. Thus, although grass blades are staple diet items for geladas, underground diet items are important fallback foods at Kosheme. Our result shows insights into the dietary flexibility southern geladas adopt to cope with human-modified landscapes of the north-central Ethiopian Highlands. Thus, the study contributes to a better understanding of how changing environments shape primate ecology and evolution.","[Kifle, Zewdu] Bahir Dar Univ, Dept Biol, Bahir Dar, Ethiopia; [Kifle, Zewdu; Bekele, Afework] Addis Ababa Univ, Dept Zool Sci, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia",zewdu96@yahoo.com,83,3,3,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

Often designing, reviewing, and assessing existing MPAs can be a complicated task often based on patchy ecological data, biases towards certain stakeholder groups, and static snapshots of current information. Taking a social-ecological resilience approach, this study has developed an innovative way of using fuzzy-set multi-criteria evaluations in GIS modelling to integrate existing ecological data for a marine area with information from a diverse set of stakeholders to gain an understanding of the overlaps between social and ecological assets within an MPA. Adaptive management frameworks were considered by exploring stakeholder feedback in regards to the current spatial plan and using a social-ecological spatially informed Bayesian Belief Network (BBN) analysis to create a current snapshot of the MPA's vulnerability. The BBN was then used to predict how climate change may affect sensitive habitats and demonstrates the increase of vulnerability for both habitats and marine species when allowing fishing pressure to occur across the entire MPA.

Understanding farmers' knowledge, attitudes, and perception towards the conservation of farmland birds is crucial to understand distribution and threats, as farmers often come across the birds year-round. We interviewed 743 farmers in four districts (Kapilvastu, Chitwan, Sarlahi, and Sunsari) of lowland Nepal. The majority of the interviewed farmers were male (72%), formally educated (66%), and 16-78 years old. Around 62% of the farmers reported having seen at least one of the 15 birds that we showed them in the interview, of which 57% recognized them correctly. Farmers from protected areas identified more birds than those from non-protected areas. However, the study revealed farmers' poor understanding of birds' names at the species level, nesting, conservation status, ecosystem services provided, and bird hunting as an illegal practice. The majority of the farmers (63%) liked all 15 birds, mainly for their beautiful appearance and sounds. Bird identification ability was correlated with birds' abundance and influenced by the respondent's gender and knowledge on birds' ecological importance. Most farmers perceived that farmland birds decline was mainly due to hunting and trade, pesticides, and lack of nesting trees in the farmlands. The baseline data of this study can be used by policymakers to develop site specific conservation action plans for farmland birds. We emphasize the pressing need of conservation interventions by government and conservation organizations to increase farmers' knowledge on birds and their ecology and their importance in ecosystems through community outreach programs and school curriculum for farmland bird conservation.

The pandemic is thus an opportunity to reflect on crucial issues: What conditions facilitate science politicization and politics scientization? What can be done to avoid these dangers and effectively ground policies in science? These issues are particularly relevant for conservation science and practice, as they encompass complex problems with multifaceted consequences and conflicts of values and interests and are thus prone to science politicization and politics scientization. We propose that grounding policymaking in science requires recognizing that: (1) science is not value-free and should be immersed in a broader process that includes conflict mediation to agree on goals; (2) science-policy partnerships should function as transdisciplinary processes; and (3) changing scientific policies and training is vital to break the vicious cycle that maintains science disconnected from society.

This is particularly pronounced in developing and densely populated countries, such as Rwanda. In-depth understanding of how ecosystems respond to threats could guide their restoration, conservation, and better management. The advancement of ecological monitoring tools is crucial for freshwater conservation. We developed and implemented an odonate-based tool, the Rwanda Dragonfly Biotic Index (RDBI), tailored to freshwater ecosystems in Rwanda as a metric to identify conservation priority sites and to monitor their restoration. The RDBI is determined based on three sub-indices: Distribution-Based Score (DBS), Threat-Based Score (TBS) and Sensitivity-Based Score (SBS). Species level-DBS increases from those that are widespread across all ecological zones to those that are restricted to only one ecological zone; TBS for a species ranges from those that are of least concern to those that are critically endangered, as per IUCN Red List; Species' SBS increases from those thriving in a highly disturbed habitat to those occurring only in a relatively intact habitat. Using RDBI, we identified hotspot habitats for odonates in Rwanda and benchmark sites for restoration. Hotspots are defined based on species richness, presence of unique species, and RDBI scores. Benchmark sites for restoration are habitats with the highest RDBI in each ecological zone. The value of using RDBI in ecosystem monitoring rests on the fact that it can help identify priority sites for conservation, and it uses organisms that are charismatic and relatively easy to identify. This is essential for citizen engagement and drawing a long-term link between policymaking, on-the-ground practices, and impacts on freshwater ecosystems.","[Uyizeye, Erasme] Keene State Coll, 115 Winchester St, Keene, NH 03431 USA; [Clausnitzer, Viola] Senckenberg Museum Nat Hist Goerlitz, Museum 1, D-02826 Goerlitz, Germany; [Kipping, Jens] BioCart Okol Gutachten & Studien, Lbrecht Durer Weg 8, D-04425 Leipzig, Germany; [Dijkstra, Klaas-Douwe B.] Nat Biodivers Ctr, Leiden, Netherlands; [Willey, Lisabeth] Antioch Univ New England, 40 Avon St, Keene, NH 03431 USA; [Kaplin, Beth A.] Univ Rwanda, Kigali, Rwanda",euyizeye@gmail.com,68,0,0,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1470-160X,ECOL INDIC,Ecol.

Identifying locations where private landowners are likely to participate in conservation initiatives can help avoid conflict and clarify trade-offs between ecological benefits and sociopolitical costs. Empirical, spatially explicit assessment of the factors associated with conservation on private land is an emerging tool for identifying future conservation opportunities. However, most data on private land conservation are voluntarily reported and incomplete, which complicates these assessments. We used a novel application of occupancy models to analyze the occurrence of conservation easements on private land. We compared multiple formulations of occupancy models with a logistic regression model to predict the locations of conservation easements based on a spatially explicit social-ecological systems framework. We combined a simulation experiment with a case study of easement data in Idaho and Montana (United States) to illustrate the utility of the occupancy framework for modeling conservation on private land. Occupancy models that explicitly accounted for variation in reporting produced estimates of predictors that were substantially less biased than estimates produced by logistic regression under all simulated conditions. Occupancy models produced estimates for the 6 predictors we evaluated in our case study that were larger in magnitude, but less certain than those produced by logistic regression. These results suggest that occupancy models result in qualitatively different inferences regarding the effects of predictors on conservation easement occurrence than logistic regression and highlight the importance of integrating variable and incomplete reporting of participation in empirical analysis of conservation initiatives. Failure to do so can lead to emphasizing the wrong social, institutional, and environmental factors that enable conservation and underestimating conservation opportunities in landscapes where social norms or institutional constraints inhibit reporting.","[Williamson, Matthew A.] Boise State Univ, Coll Innovat & Design, Human Environm Syst, 1910 Univ Dr, Boise, ID 83725 USA; [Dickson, Brett G.] Conservat Sci Partners Inc, 11050 Pioneer Trail,Suite 202, Truckee, CA 96161 USA; [Dickson, Brett G.] No Arizona Univ, Landscape Conservat Initiat, POB 5694, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA; [Hooten, Mevin B.] Colorado State Univ, Dept Fish Wildlife & Conservat Biol & Stat, Colorado Cooperat Fish & Wildlife Res Unit, US Geol Survey, 1484 Campus Delivery Ft, Collins, CO 80521 USA; [Graves, Rose A.] Portland State Univ, Global Environm Change Lab, 1825 SW Broadway, Portland, OR 97201 USA; [Graves, Rose A.] Portland State Univ, Nat Conservancy, 1825 SW Broadway, Portland, OR 97201 USA; [Lubell, Mark N.; Schwartz, Mark W.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Environm Sci & Policy, One Shields Ave, Davis, CA 95616 USA",mattwilliamson@boisestate.edu,55,3,3,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0888-8892,CONSERV BIOL,Conserv.

The development of the Plant Micro-Reserve (PMR) is an efficient concept for the in situ conservation of rare plants with narrow ecological niche and threatened by human impacts. We provide a framework for initiating site selection of PMRs, including evolutionary and ecological uniqueness. The proposed cross-analysis is based on (i) the estimate of population vulnerability, (ii) the contribution of each population to the evolutionary originality of the species by designating conservation units, and (iii) the gap analysis of the current protection status of the populations. As a case study, we apply this framework to the Nice Snowflake Acis nicaeensis, a narrow Mediterranean endemic plant of the French-Italian Riviera which, being caught in the turmoil of urban sprawl, is threatened by tremendous anthropogenic pressures. On the basis of historical data (past land-use and herbarium data) we show that over the last 150 years, the impact of urbanization has been severe for 70 % of the populations and has caused the disappearance of at least 11 of them, i.e. 20 % of the known populations. Similar levels of urban sprawl are observed between the most vulnerable and already extinct populations. In this context of biodiversity decline, our cross-analysis highlights that two of the five conservation units call for a rapid setting up of PMRs because of their high originality and their great risk of extinction: one unit including the populations of the Principality of Monaco and one unit that includes the populations of Nice and its surroundings. This study demonstrates the importance of integrating population vulnerability and conservation units. In a context of huge urbanization our approach makes a clear case for the design of PMRs.","[Medail, Frederic; Pouget, Marine; Baumel, Alex] Aix Marseille Univ, CNRS, Inst Mediterraneen Biodivers & Ecol Marine & Cont, Avignon Univ,Technopole Arbois Mediterranee,IRD, BP 80, F-13545 Aix En Provence 4, France; [Diadema, Katia] Conservatoire Bot Natl Mediterraneen Porquerolles, 34 Ave Gambetta, F-83400 Hyeres, France",frederic.medail@imbe.fr; k.diadema@cbnmed.fr; alex.baumel@imbe.fr,47,0,0,ELSEVIER GMBH,MUNICH,"HACKERBRUCKE 6, 80335 MUNICH, GERMANY",1617-1381,J NAT CONSERV,J.

Predicting the potential distributions of mangroves is vital for policy makers and stakeholders to enforce conservation and reforestation measures. China is at the global northern margin of mangrove distribution. In this study, we used the maximum entropy (MaxEnt) model to predict potentially suitable habitats for mangroves based on current data of mangrove distributions in mainland China. For modeling, we grouped the native and exotic mangrove species in China into five groups and used 30 bioclimate, topographic, substrate, and sea surface temperature variables to predict mangrove distributions. The results show that bioclimate and sea surface temperature are both important factors that determine mangrove distribution. The largest suitable area modeled for mangrove species in the coastal zone was 2705 km(2). About 14.8% of the predicted suitable habitat for the five mangrove groups is under protection in mangrove nature reserves. Along China's coastline, 15 sites were identified as hotspots for mangrove conservation and reforestation. By comparing these results with current conservation efforts, we identified that protection priority should be given to the Beilun River Estuary to Fangcheng Harbor coastal zone in Guangxi Province, the east coast of the Leizhou Peninsula in Guangdong Province, and the Meizhou Bay to Xinghua Bay area in Fujian Province. In addition, suitable species selection should also be considered to achieve successful mangrove reforestation.","[Hu, Wenjia; Zhang, Dian; Yu, Weiwei; Ma, Zhiyuan; Chen, Guangcheng; Liu, Zhenghua; Du, Jianguo; Chen, Bin] Minist Nat Resources, Inst Oceanog 3, Xiamen, Peoples R China; [Wang, Yuyu; Lei, Guangchun] Beijing Forestry Univ, Sch Ecol & Nat Conservat, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Dong, Peng] Chinese Acad Sci, Aerosp Informat Res Inst, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Hu, Wenjia; Yu, Weiwei; Ma, Zhiyuan; Chen, Guangcheng; Liu, Zhenghua; Du, Jianguo; Chen, Bin] Fujian Prov Key Lab Marine Ecol Conservat & Resto, Xiamen, Peoples R China",chenbin@tio.org.cn; guangchun.lei@foxmail.com,86,7,10,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0378-1127,FOREST ECOL MANAG,For.

However, the niche-specific megaherbivores residing outside protected areas face more imminent extinction threats. Swamp deer, the obligate grassland-dwelling endemic cervid is the most extinction-prone megaherbivore in the Indian subcontinent. Limited information on distribution and habitat status pose significant conservation and management challenges for the remaining fragmented populations in north, north-east and central India. To this end, we combined exhaustive field surveys and Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) modeling to generate the most detailed distribution map for the northern swamp deer subspecies. We used primary data from more than 6000 km(2) field surveys and eight ecologically relevant covariates for model predictions. Grassland cover, annual mean temperature and distance from water were the major factors that predicted the species distribution. Models predicted swamp deer distribution in only-3% of the entire landscape, covering both protected (-1.4%) as well as non-protected (-1.6%) areas. Our validation surveys in some of these predicted areas confirmed swamp deer presence and indicated-85% model accuracy. Finally, we identified four Priority Conservation Areasstill retaining adequate grassland habitat and species presence that require immediate attention to ensure landscape-level population connectivity. These results highlight the importance of the marginalized grassland ecosystems of northern India that still retain high biodiversity. We suggest a swamp deer-centric conservation approach to protect these human-dominated habitats and emphasize in generating such information for other endemic, habitat-specialist species across the globe.

We evaluated effects of climate change on the distribution of climatically suitable areas of D. sinicus as found prevailing during the last glacial maximum (LGM), the mid-Holocene and the present time, and predicted the distribution of climatically suitable habitats in 2070 throughout East Asia. The results as derived from ecological niche modeling (ENM) show the current distribution to be limited to the prehistoric (the mid-Holocene and LGM) refugia, and to indicate decreasing probability of presence and a reducing range of distribution for 2070. In addition, the suitable areas predicted with high probability (0.51) only account for on average 9.8% of the total area of potential habitats (threshold-1) among the models for the year 2070, thereby indicating that D. sinicus is highly vulnerable. Under all the future scenarios for the year 2070, 69-74.2% of potential habitats in China would be outside protected areas.

For habitat-forming organisms in particular, understanding the relationship between larval connectivity and meta-population dynamics aids in planning for marine spatial management. Here, we estimate networks of connectivity between fringing coral reefs in the northwest shelf of Australia by combining a particle tracking model based on shelf circulation with models of subpopulation dynamics of individual reefs. Coral cover data were used as a proxy for overall habitat quality, which can change as a result of natural processes, human-driven impacts, and management initiatives. We obtain three major results of conservation significance. First, the dynamics of the ecological network result from the interplay between network connectivity and ecological processes on individual reefs. The maximum coral cover a zone can sustain imposes a significant nonlinearity on the role an individual reef plays within the dynamics of the network, and thus on the impact of conservation interventions on specific reefs. Second, the role of an individual reef within these network dynamics changes considerably depending on the overall state of the system: a reef's role in sustaining the system's state can be different from the same reef's role in helping the system recover following major disturbance. Third, patterns of network connectivity change significantly as a function of yearly shelf circulation trends, and nonlinearity in network dynamics make mean connectivity a poor representation of yearly variations. From a management perspective, the priority list of reefs that are targets for management interventions depends crucially on what type of stressors (system-wide vs. localized) need addressing. This choice also depends not only on the ultimate purpose of management, but also on future oceanographic, climate change, and development scenarios that will determine the network connectivity and habitat quality.","[Boschetti, Fabio; Babcock, Russell C.; Doropoulos, Christopher; Thomson, Damian P.; Feng, Ming; Slawinski, Dirk; Berry, Oliver; Vanderklift, Mathew A.] Commonwealth Sci & Ind Org, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia",Fabio.Boschetti@csiro.au,51,6,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1051-0761,ECOL APPL,Ecol.

The use of precautionary measures and data-poor methods have been recommended as valuable tools to guide the management and conservation of marine taxa when information is scarce and the effect of fisheries on populations is evident. A Productivity Susceptibility Analysis (PSA) and intrinsic rebound potential (r) estimates were used to evaluate the vulnerability and resilience of elasmobranchs before and after a precautionary measure (closure of the fishery) was implemented in the Archipelago of San Andres, Providencia and Santa Catalina, Colombia (Seaflower Biosphere Reserve). We identified locally large information gaps, specifically on the demographic and life history parameters of the 15 elasmobranch species (13 sharks and 2 rays) evaluated for the Archipelago. Including fishing effects, nine large commercial shark species were identified as the most vulnerable and with the lowest intrinsic rebound potential, while the least vulnerable species was the whale shark (Rhincodon typus), which presented the third highest value of r(2M). Once the fishery was closed, the vulnerability of large sharks decreased greatly. Our findings highlight the importance of: involving communities to achieve effective management processes; implementing precautionary measures for high impact and targeted fisheries; and using valuable data-poor tools for the study of populations as an alternative for evaluating and suggesting management measures. Finally, based in PSA and intrinsic rebound potential results, it is suggested to maintain the fishing ban in consensus with the fishermen, and to evaluate economic alternatives already being generated in the area such as recreational diving and ecological tourism, among others.

The efficiency of these practices may be affected by high variability and uncertainty associated with seasonal rainfall, especially for areas such as Cote d'Ivoire, where intra-seasonal rainfall has been observed to change from 1year to another. The DSSAT crop simulation model was used in this study as a tool to evaluate the impacts of soil improvement options including inorganic fertilizer and conservation agriculture generating higher carbon sequestration and crop yield in maize agro-ecosystems. The model was calibrated using agronomic data for three cropping seasons from 2009 to 2010 in Goulikao (Center-West Cote d'Ivoire) and Aheremou 2 (Central Cote d'Ivoire), respectively and validated against independent datasets of yield of 2003-2004 seasons in the buffer zone of the Lamto Natural Reserve, Central Cote d'Ivoire. The model predicted average maize yields of 1454kgha(-1) across the sites versus an observed average value of 1736kgha(-1), R-2 of 0.72, and RMSE of 597kgha(-1) after the default values for stable soil organic matter fraction used in the model were substituted by the estimated one. For the validation, the predicted higher maize yield was consistently related to fallow biomass inputs and different rates of fertilizer, thus generating a RMSE of total aboveground biomass and grain yield of 606kgha(-1) and 350kgha(-1), respectively. The impact of fallow residues and cropping sequence on subsequent maize yield was simulated and compared with conventional fertilizer and control data using 12years historic climate time series. We conclude that soil fertility improvements through conservation agriculture can sustain grain yield at the same level as conventional inputs of urea against larger climate variability. However, this system may be substituted by conventional agriculture when climate forecast reveals a dry cropping season year.","[Worou, Omonlola Nadine] Int Crops Res Inst Semi Arid Trop, BP320, Bamako, Mali; [Tondoh, Jerome Ebagnerin] West African Sci Serv Ctr Climate Change & Adapte, 06 BP 9507, Ouagadougou 06, Burkina Faso; [Tondoh, Jerome Ebagnerin; Kone, Armand Wowo] Univ Nangui Abrogoua, UFR Sci Nat, Ctr Rech Ecol, 02 BP 801, Abidjan 02, Cote Ivoire; [Gaiser, Thomas] Univ Bonn, Inst Crop Sci & Resource Conservat, D-53115 Bonn, Germany; [Guei, Arnauth Martinez] Univ Jean Lorougnon Guede, UFR Agroforesterie, Ctr Rech Ecol, BP 150, Daloa, Cote Ivoire; [Edoukou, Flavien Ettien] Ctr Rech Ecol, 08 BP 109, Abidjan 08, Cote Ivoire",n.worou@cgiar.org; jetondoh@gmail.com; konearmand@yahoo.fr; tgaiser@uni-bonn.de; gamboy80@yahoo.fr; edflavien@yahoo.fr,21,1,1,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1436-3798,REG ENVIRON CHANGE,Reg.

We sampled butterflies and 11 environmental factors in 60 randomly selected sites across four 500-m elevation zones, representing seven habitat types. Rural mosaics and riverine vegetation were the habitats with the highest diversity of butterflies. Within habitats, the number of flower heads was the most important factor favouring butterfly species richness and abundance and endemic butterfly richness, while soil humidity had a positive effect on species richness and abundance. Although the Natura 2000 network succeeds in including the majority of butterfly species and all Cyprian endemics, the transects sampled within the network did not support more butterfly species than those outside it, and were significantly poorer in terms of butterfly abundance and endemic butterfly species richness and abundance. We found a similar pattern for the Habitats Directive priority habitats, which held poorer overall and endemic butterfly communities than the other habitats. The effectiveness of existing protected area networks may need to be reassessed in regions such as the South East Mediterranean, to ensure that regionally important components of biological diversity are adequately protected. To this aim, our results suggest that new European and national policies as well as further inclusion of rural mosaics and riverine habitats in protected area networks are needed for effective butterfly conservation in Cyprus.","[Tzirkalli, Elli; Halley, John M.; Kati, Vassiliki] Univ Ioannina, Dept Biol Applicat & Technol, GR-45110 Ioannina, Greece; [Tzirkalli, Elli; Kadis, Costas] Frederick Res Ctr, Filokyprou 7-9, CY-1036 Nicosia, Cyprus; [Kadis, Costas] Frederick Univ, Nat Conservat Unit, POB 24729, CY-1303 Nicosia, Cyprus; [Vogiatzakis, Ioannis] Open Univ Cyprus, Sch Pure & Appl Sci, POB 12794, CY-2252 Nicosia, Cyprus; [Wilson, Robert J.] CSIC, Natl Museum Nat Sci MNCN, Dept Biogeog & Global Change, Madrid 28006, Spain; [Zografou, Konstantina] Temple Univ, Dept Biol, 1900 North 12th St, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA; [Antoniou, Andreas] Minist Agr Rural Dev & Environm, Dept Environm, CY-2414 Nicosia, Cyprus; [Tsintides, Takis] Minist Agr Rural Dev & Environm, Dept Forest, CY-1414 Nicosia, Cyprus",vkati@uoi.gr,96,0,0,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0960-3115,BIODIVERS CONSERV,Biodivers.

Existing data are limited for Hispaniola's two threatened nonvolant land mammals, the Hispaniolan hutia (Plagiodontia aedium) and Hispaniolan solenodon (Solenodon paradoxus), with assumptions that hutias are better able to tolerate landscape disturbance. We collected spatial behaviour and habitat use data for Hispaniolan mammals during a multi-year field programme across undisturbed and modified habitats in southwestern Dominican Republic, using GPS units for hutias (11 individuals) and radiotelemetry for solenodons (22 individuals). Although significant differences exist in hutia home range estimates between different GPS error derivation strategies and estimated terrestrial/arboreal behaviour scenarios (95% KDE means = 23,582-28,612 m(2)), hutias almost exclusively use forest under all estimates (mean observations in forest across all strategies/scenarios = 90.3%, total range = 69.1-100%). Solenodons have larger estimated home ranges (95% KDE mean = 156,700 m(2)), with differences between wet and dry season estimates, and show much more variation in habitat use than hutias within the same landscape; animals regularly use both forested and modified habitats, being observed most frequently in forest (mean = 74.0%, range = 13.0-99.1%) but also occurring regularly in pasture (mean = 15.9%, range = 0-80.0%) and cropland (mean = 7.7%, range = 0-62.0%), and den in all three habitats.

We review how ecological guidelines for improving marine reserve design can be adapted based on an area's unique evolutionary, oceanic, and ecological characteristics in the Gulf of California, Mexico. We provide ecological guidelines to maximize benefits for fisheries management, biodiversity conservation and climate change adaptation. These guidelines include: representing 30% of each major habitat (and multiple examples of each) in marine reserves within each of three biogeographic subregions; protecting critical areas in the life cycle of focal species (spawning and nursery areas) and sites with unique biodiversity; and establishing reserves in areas where local threats can be managed effectively. Given that strong, asymmetric oceanic currents reverse direction twice a year, to maximize connectivity on an ecological time scale, reserves should be spaced less than 50-200km apart depending on the planktonic larval duration of target species; and reserves should be located upstream of fishing sites, taking the reproductive timing of focal species in consideration. Reserves should be established for the long term, preferably permanently, since full recovery of all fisheries species is likely to take>25years. Reserve size should be based on movement patterns of focal species, although marine reserves>10km long are likely to protect80% of fish species. Since climate change will affect species' geographic range, larval duration, growth, reproduction, abundance, and distribution of key recruitment habitats, these guidelines may require further modifications to maintain ecosystem function in the future.","[Munguia-Vega, Adrian; Suarez-Castillo, Alvin N.; Jose Espinosa-Romero, Maria; Torre, Jorge] Comunidad & Biodiversidad AC, Guaymas, Sonora, Mexico; [Munguia-Vega, Adrian] Univ Arizona, Conservat Genet Lab, Sch Nat Resources & Environm, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Green, Alison L.] Nature Conservancy, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Aburto-Oropeza, Octavio; Giron-Nava, Alfredo; Moreno-Baez, Marcia] Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, Div Marine Biol Res, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Cisneros-Montemayor, Andres M.] Univ British Columbia, Nippon Fdn, Nereus Program, Inst Oceans & Fisheries, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Cruz-Pinon, Gabriela; Reyes-Bonilla, Hector] Univ Autonoma Baja California Sur, Dept Biol Marina, La Paz, Baja California, Mexico; [Danemann, Gustavo] Pronatura Noroeste AC, Ensenada, Baja California, Mexico; [Gonzalez-Cuellar, Ollin; Hudson Weaver, Amy] Soc Hist Nat Niparaja AC, La Paz, Baja California, Mexico; [Lasch, Cristina] Nature Conservancy, Merida, Yucatan, Venezuela; [del Mar Mancha-Cisneros, Maria] Arizona State Univ, Sch Life Sci, Ecol Evolut & Environm Sci, Tempe, AZ USA; [Guido Marinone, Silvio] Ctr Invest Cient & Educ Super Ensenada, Dept Oceanog Fis, Ensenada, Baja California, Mexico; [Moreno-Baez, Marcia] Univ New England, Dept Environm Studies, Biddeford, ME USA; [Morzaria-Luna, Hem-Nalini; Turk-Boyer, Peggy] Ctr Intercultural Estudio Desiertos & Oceanos AC, Puerto Penasco, Sonora, Mexico; [Morzaria-Luna, Hem-Nalini] NOAA, Northwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, Seattle, WA USA; [Walther, Mariana] Nature Conservancy, La Paz, Baja California, Mexico",airdrian@email.arizona.edu,105,22,22,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0960-3166,REV FISH BIOL FISHER,Rev.

The lesser long-nosed bat (Leptonycteris yerbabuenae) is a migratory pollinator bat that was removed from the Endangered Species List in the United States in 2018 and from threatened status in Mexico in 2013. The seasonal ecology and conservation status of the species is well understood in the core part of its range on mainland Mexico and in the southwestern United States, but relatively little is known about the species on the Baja California peninsula in northwestern Mexico, a part of its range range separated by the Gulf of California. We studied the seasonal ecology of lesser long-nosed bats on the Baja peninsula at 8 focal roosts along a 450-km north-to-south transect to test hypotheses about migratory or residential status of the species on the Baja peninsula. We provide evidence of an extensive population of lesser long-nosed bats on the Baja peninsula that is primarily seasonally migratory and includes 2 mating roosts with males on the southern part of the peninsula. Seasonal ecology of lesser long-nosed bats was closely associated with the flowering and fruiting season of the cardOn (Pachycereus pringlei), the dominant columnar cactus on the peninsula. However, we discovered that some female lesser long-nosed bats arrive and give birth at southern roosts in mid-February, about 2 months earlier than other migratory populations in more northern Sonoran Desert habitats. We documented the loss of nearly a third of the known maternity roosts during the study, demonstrating that action to protect key roosts remains a high priority. Migratory pollinators are particularly vulnerable to climate and land-use changes and we recommend continued monitoring and research to guide effective range-wide conservation of the species.","[Frick, Winifred E.] Bat Conservat Int, Austin, TX 78746 USA; [Frick, Winifred E.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Santa Cruz, CA 95060 USA; [Heady, Paul A., III] Bat Conservat Res & Serv, Aptos, CA 95001 USA; [Earl, Alexis D.] Conservat Metr Inc, Santa Cruz, CA 95060 USA; [Clara Arteaga, Maria] CICESE, Dept Biol Conservac, Carretera Ensenada Tijuana 3918, Ensenada 22860, Baja California, Mexico; [Cortes-Calva, Patricia] Ctr Invest Biol Noroeste, Programa Planeac Ambiental, Av Inst Politecn Nacl 195, La Paz 23096, Baja Calif Sur, Mexico; [Medellin, Rodrigo A.] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Dept Ecol Biodiversidad, Inst Ecol, Apartado Postal 70-275, Mexico City 04510, DF, Mexico",wfrick@batcon.org,33,4,5,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0022-2372,J MAMMAL,J.

Here, we combine the effects of climate changes and Artocarpus heterophyllus Lam. (Moraceae) invasion on the SCP for endemic aromatic fruit tree species from the Atlantic Forest (EFAF). We tested the effect of invasion on SCP measures of species turnover, biotic stability, and irreplaceability. Ecological niche models were used to establish species environmental suitability for the preindustrial period for both invasive species and EFAF and to forecast to the end of the century (2080-2100). We calculated the niche overlap between the invasive species and EFAF and tested the overlap significance using a null model. We tested the biological invasion effect on the results using results with no species invasion correction. The niche overlap between A. heterophyllus and EFAF was significant for 50% of species in the preindustrial period and for 33% in the future. The spatial patterns of species turnover, biotic stability, and irreplaceability had significant effects on biological invasion changing the spatial pattern in both shape and magnitude, which can misplace and overvalue conservation priorities. We showed that the disregard of biological invasion on SCP can cause negative effects on SCP under climate change.

Today, Wichis live in stable communities and practice subsistence hunting, gathering and in some cases, fishing. Criollos are mestizos, i.e. a mixture of the first Spanish settlers and different indigenous groups. They arrived during the 20th century from neighbouring Provinces. They practice extensive ranching, hunting and gathering. Our aim was to help develop effective and legitimate actions to conserve wildlife species in this region, focused on Wichis' and Criollos' perceptions of and relations with wildlife. We conducted semi-structured interviews (N = 105) in rural settlements. We found differences in both groups' hunting techniques, drivers and perceptions on the importance of wild meat for nutrition. However, both groups have a close relation with wildlife, they use wild animals in a variety of ways, including as food resource, medicine and predictors of future events. Wichis and Criollos also relate with wildlife in a spiritual dimension, have animistic and shamanic beliefs and have unique traditional ecological knowledge. Hunters in both communities are breaking traditional hunting norms but conservation measures grounded on these norms have a higher probability of success. Management recommendations include developing programmes focused on (i) conserving thin armadillos; (ii) conserving pregnant and breeding females of all species; (iii) managing dogs to avoid unnecessary killings and on (iv) improving local livelihoods.

Riverscape ecology emphasizes interactions among processes at different scales and their consequences for valued ecosystem components, such as riverine fishes. Past studies have focused strongly on understanding the ecological processes in riverscapes and how human actions modify those processes. It is increasingly clear, however, that an understanding of the drivers behind actions that lead to human modification also merit consideration, especially regarding how those drivers influence management efficacy. These indirect drivers of riverscape outcomes can be understood in the context of a diverse array of social processes, which we collectively refer to as human dimensions. Like ecological phenomena, social processes also exhibit complex interactions across spatiotemporal scales. Greater emphasis on feedbacks between social and ecological processes will lead scientists and managers to more completely understand riverscapes as complex, dynamic, interacting social-ecological systems. Emerging applications in riverscapes, as well as studies of other ecosystems, provide examples that can lead to stronger integration of social and ecological science. We argue that conservation successes within riverscapes may not come from better ecological science, improved ecosystem service analyses, or even economic incentives if the fundamental drivers of human behaviors are not understood and addressed in conservation planning and implementation.

In this work we studied the gap between science and conservation actions in Brazil. We mapped scientific literature on conservation and conducted online surveys with science experts on biodiversity and policymakers working on a federal sphere. Our results show that environmental issues considered as priority for policymakers did not relate to those suggested by scientists and the peer-reviewed literature. According to policymakers, the main barriers to access scientific literature were time available to read papers, difficulty in understanding technical language and reading in English. Our results confirm that, in general, scientific knowledge is not being sufficiently applied to support policies in Brazil. Both scientists and policymakers are responsible for improving communication between their institutions: researchers need to know in advance what are professional policymakers' needs and direct their research towards answering policy-related questions; and policymakers need that scientific evidences be available in accessible language and up to date. We recommend the development of science communication departments at all governmental levels and the establishment of evidence based research groups and tools. Our findings help to explain the mismatch between science and policy in Brazil and represent a warning to everyone engaged in biodiversity conservation worldwide.

A multi-disciplinary, multi-scale approach that combines tools informing in the short-term (i.e. photo-identification), with mid-term ecological tracers (stable isotopes -C-13, N-15 and S-34- and persistent organic pollutants -POPs-), and mid- to long-term genetic markers (microsatellites and mitochondrial DNA), was used to define management units within bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) inhabiting the southern Iberian Peninsula. Although genetically indistinguishable, individuals inhabiting the Strait of Gibraltar and the Gulf of Cadiz showed differences in their isotopic composition and the concentrations of certain POPs. Accordingly, the lack of photographic recaptures between the two sites pointed to the existence of at least two different ecological management units that segregate spatially and may require different conservation strategies. Different time-scale approaches can reveal different management units. The results highlighted the use of medium- and short-term approaches for properly identifying ecologically different units for effective management and conservation. Furthermore, these results have important management implications as European legislation promotes specific management plans for this species.","[Gimenez, Joan; Ramirez, Francisco; Forero, Manuela G.] Spanish Council Sci Res CSIC, EBD, Seville, Spain; [Louis, Marie] Ctr Etud Biol Chize, Villiers En Bois, France; [Louis, Marie] Univ St Andrews, Scottish Oceans Inst, St Andrews, Fife, Scotland; [Baron, Enrique; Eljarrat, Ethel; Barcelo, Damia; de Stephanis, Renaud] Spanish Council Sci Res CSIC, Inst Environm Assessment & Water Res IDAEA, Barcelona, Spain; [Verborgh, Philippe; Gauffier, Pauline; Esteban, Ruth] CIRCE Conservat Informat & Res Cetaceans, Algeciras, Spain",gimenez.verdugo@gmail.com,82,16,16,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1052-7613,AQUAT CONSERV,Aquat.

However, accelerated biodiversity loss and lack of social acceptance of PAs call into question their ability to reach long-term biodiversity conservation objectives. To address this, conservation scientists and practitioners have moved from segregative to integrative models of PAs. When the segregative model sees PAs as human exclusion zones, the integrative model considers conservation and development projects and multiple partnerships with local stakeholders within and outside PAs. Given this paradigmatic evolution, a PA and its surrounding landscape are increasingly regarded as a single social-ecological system (SES). This development brings new challenges for conservationists: How should these complex and dynamic systems be managed, and how can their pathways be described and piloted? Using French nature reserves (NRs) as case studies, we propose a framework for analyzing the integration pathways of PAs within their social-ecological context. We identified the pathways of 10 NRs according to their degree of integration in the surrounding landscape (spatial), their management objectives (sectoral), and their governance systems (institutional). We analyzed these pathways using three metaphors associated with resilience thinking (adaptive cycle, adaptation, and transformation). We discussed how these 10 NRs have changed over time, revealing how practitioners anticipate future pathways and avoid undesirable states. Through an exploration of the totality of an SES's spatial, sectoral, and institutional pathways, the framework we propose is a potential tool for identifying opportunities and constraints for long-term conservation actions.","[Therville, Clara; Mathevet, Raphael] CNRS, UMR CEFE 5175, 1919 Route deMende, F-34293 Montpellier 5, France; [Therville, Clara; Bioret, Frederic] Univ Bretagne Occidentale, EA Geoarchitecture 2119, CS93837, F-29238 Brest, France; [Therville, Clara] Reserves Nat France, CS67524, F-21075 Dijon, France; [Antona, Martine] CIRAD, UPR GREEN, Campus Int Baillarguet, F-34398 Montpellier 5, France",clara.therville@gmail.com,81,4,4,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1436-3798,REG ENVIRON CHANGE,Reg.

We used spatially explicit models to determine genetic population structure under current and future environmental conditions across a highly fragmented, human-dominated environment in Southern California to assess the effects of natural ecological variation and urbanization. We focused on 7 common species with diverse habitat requirements, home-range sizes, and dispersal abilities. We quantified the relative roles of potential barriers, including natural environmental characteristics and an anthropogenic barrier created by a major highway, in shaping genetic variation. The ability to predict genetic variation in our models differed among species: 11-81% of intraspecific genetic variation was explained by environmental variables. Although an anthropogenically induced barrier (a major highway) severely restricted gene flow and movement at broad scales for some species, genetic variation seemed to be primarily driven by natural environmental heterogeneity at a local level. Our results show how assessing environmentally associated variation for multiple species under current and future climate conditions can help identify priority regions for maximizing population persistence under environmental change in urbanized regions.","[Thomassen, Henri A.] Univ Tubingen, Comparat Zool, Inst Evolut & Ecol, Morgenstelle 28, D-72076 Tubingen, Germany; [Thomassen, Henri A.; Harrigan, Ryan J.; Smith, Thomas B.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Ctr Trop Res, La Kretz Hall,Suite 300, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Semple Delaney, Kathleen; Riley, Seth P.

Responding to concern expressed by the Kitasoo Xai'xais (KX) First Nation over a decline in mountain goat (Oreamnos americanus) sightings, our community-academic partnership assessed the conservation status of goats in KX territory and beyond in British Columbia by evaluating three independent information sources. Aerial surveys (2019 and 2020) over 542 km(2) revealed a low-density population (mean 0.25, SD 0.12 goats/km(2)), typical of peripheral coastal range. Interviews with KX Knowledge Holders revealed that sightings from sea level have declined sharply over 40 years, a period during which temperatures have increased and snowpack has decreased. Finally, Kill data (1980-2018) showed that kills/hunter/day initially increased among guided hunters before plateauing, but declined among resident hunters (similar to 70% of hunt days) in both coastal and interior BC. Convergent patterns among datasets suggest that coastal goats declined in abundance and/or reduced use of low-elevation habitat, disrupting a millennia-old relationship between KX people and goats, thereby posing a conservation concern. Broadly, our work shows that detecting threats to peripheral populations, and wildlife in general, can be informed and empowered by the knowledge of place-based peoples and associated decentralized management.

Less public attention has been paid to how hunting (even of threatened species) can be useful as a conservation tool, and likely outcomes if this was stopped. As case studies, we examine the regulated legal hunting of two African rhino species in South Africa and Namibia over the last half-century. Counter-intuitively, removing a small number of specific males can enhance population demography and genetic diversity, encourage range expansion, and generate meaningful socioeconomic benefits to help fund effective conservation (facilitated by appropriate local institutional arrangements). Legal hunting of African rhinos has been sustainable, with very small proportions of populations hunted each year, and greater numbers of both species today in these countries than when controlled recreational hunting began. Terminating this management option and significant funding source could have negative consequences at a time when rhinos are being increasingly viewed as liabilities and revenue generation for wildlife areas is being significantly impacted by COVID-19. Provided that there is appropriate governance, conservation of certain highly threatened species can be supported by cautiously selective and limited legal hunting.","['t Sas-Rolfes, Michael] Univ Oxford, Sch Geog & Environm, Oxford, England; ['t Sas-Rolfes, Michael] Univ Oxford, Oxford Martin Sch, Oxford, England; [Emslie, Richard] Ecoscot Consultancy Serv, Hilton, South Africa; [Adcock, Keryn] Wild Solut, Hilton, South Africa; [Knight, Michael] Nelson Mandela Univ, Ctr African Conservat Ecol, Zool Dept, Port Elizabeth, South Africa",tsas.rolfes@gmail.com,31,0,0,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1755-263X,CONSERV LETT,Conserv.

Although studying ungulate ecology of fear is common, knowledge from ungulate systems is highly contested among ecologists. Here, we review the available literature on the ecology of fear in ungulates to generalize our current knowledge and how we can leverage it for conservation. Four general focus areas emerged from the 275 papers included in our literature search (and some papers were included in multiple categories): behavioral responses to predation risk (79%), physiological responses to predation risk (15%), trophic cascades resulting from ungulate responses to predation risk (20%), and manipulation of predation risk (1%). Of papers focused on behavior, 75% were about movement and habitat selection. Studies were biased toward North America (53%), tended to be focused on elk (Cervus canadensis; 29%), and were dominated by gray wolves (40%) or humans (39%) as predators of interest. Emerging literature suggests that we can utilize predation risk for conservation with top-down (i.e., increasing predation risk) and bottom-up (i.e., manipulating landscape characteristics to increase risk or risk perception) approaches. It is less clear whether fear-related changes in physiology have population-level fitness consequences or cascading effects, which could be fruitful avenues for future research. Conflicting evidence of trait-mediated trophic cascades might be improved with better replication across systems and accounting for confounding effects of ungulate density. Improving our understanding of mechanisms modulating the nature of trophic cascades likely is most important to ensure desirable conservation outcomes. We recommend future work embrace the complexity of natural systems by attempting to link together the focal areas of study identified herein.","[Chitwood, M.

Among the key secondary terms (recurring < 5%), although corridors, continuity, and contiguity showed a slight growth over the decades, connectivity conservation showed the most significant increase. This last landscape-related term recently replaced other local-scale concepts (as stepping stones and corridors) as a consequence of a change of perspective. Conversely, ecological network planning, used in landscape planning and less in conservation biology, showed a comparable fewer recurrence.

This area is also one of the key components of the ecological security shelter (ESS) for national ecological security and biodiversity conservation. Due to the combination of man-made and natural factors, Southwest China has suffered serious ecological degradation that directly threatens ecological security which refers to the health status of ecosystems and ESs functions. Mapping ESs-based ecological security patterns (ESPs) is essential for designing conservation strategies that suitably combine regional environment conservation with sustainable utilization. We used the InVEST (Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs Tool) model to identify ecological conservation priority areas which integrated ecological sensitivity (soil erosion sensitivity, rock desertification sensitivity, landslide sensitivity, debris flow sensitivity, and freezing-thawing erosion sensitivity), ecological risk (drought risk, natural disaster risk, and socio-economic risk), and ecological conservation importance (soil conservation, water conservation, and biodiversity conservation importance). In this research, we summarized a new designing framework of ESs-based ESPs. We divided the study area into two zones and four belts including: (A) the alpine steppe and wetland zone, (B) Hengduan Mountain zone, (C) northern shelter belt (Daba-Micang Mountain), (D) central shelter belt (Wumeng-Wuling Mountain), (E) southern shelter belt (southern border of China), and (F) southwestern shelter belt (eastern Himalayas Mountain). Identifying distributions of the ESs-based ESPs has practical significance to improve local human wellbeing and to maintain sustainable development of natural-social ecosystems in Southwest China. Furthermore, ESs-based ESPs are necessary for local administrations to create rationalizing plans on balancing conservation and utilization of natural resources, so that policy-makers can put into place targeted prevention and control measures to limit the development of excessive consumption of natural resources and ecological damages, which is worth promoting.","[Su, Xukun; Shen, Yu; Xiao, Yi; Liu, Yuqing; Cheng, Hao; Wan, Lingfan; Liu, Guohua] Chinese Acad Sci, Res Ctr Ecoenvironm Sci, State Key Lab Urban & Reg Ecol, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Su, Xukun; Shen, Yu; Xiao, Yi; Liu, Yuqing; Cheng, Hao; Wan, Lingfan; Liu, Guohua] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Coll Resources & Environm, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Su; Yang, Murong] Yunnan Univ, Inst Int Rivers & Ecosecur, Kunming, Yunnan, Peoples R China; [Wang, Qiusheng] Inner Mongolia Univ, Sch Ecol & Environm, Hohhot, Peoples R China",xiaoyi@rcees.ac.cn; ghliu@rcees.ac.cn,57,0,0,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",2296-701X,FRONT ECOL EVOL,Front.

It is not clear how much this process contributes to ecological diversification of alpine species. To examine this problem, we test patterns of genetic and phenotypic divergence in two co-distributed species complexes of flightless alpine ground beetles. Greater differentiation in functional traits would indicate that ecological selection is an outcome of oscillating climate change, whereas greater differentiation in non-ecological traits would indicate niche conservatism. Location The Cascades Range and Trinity Mountains of western North America. Taxon Nebria paradisi and N. vandykei species complexes (Insecta: Coleoptera: Carabidae: Nebriinae). Methods We generated genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism data and mitochondrial sequence data, as well as morphological and physiological data, to compare populations spanning the range of both species. Phylogenetic and population genetic analyses were used to infer relationships among taxa and populations in each species complex, as well as historical demography. Support vector machines were used to test for classification of taxa and populations based on ecomorphological, ecophysiological and male reproductive traits. Mantel tests were then used to assess associations between phenotypic and genetic divergence among populations. Results The N. vandykei and N. paradisi species complexes are each comprised of genetically distinctive populations exhibiting long-term demographic declines. Each phylogeny supports multiple monophyletic groups with geographical cohesion. By examining phenotypic traits among populations in both species' complexes, we show that reproductive trait divergence can discriminate species and population status more effectively than ecomorphological or ecophysiological traits. Reproductive and genetic divergence are significantly correlated in the N. vandykei species complex. Main Conclusions We found limited evidence of ecological selection acting on functional traits. Instead, reproductive and genetic divergence evolved among isolated populations in both species complexes, suggesting niche conservatism may be a common outcome in alpine species diversification.","[Schat, Jillian; Weng, Yi-Ming; Luo, Lan; Schoville, Sean D.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Entomol, 1630 Linden Dr,637 Russell Labs, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Dudko, Roman Yu] Russian Acad Sci, Inst Systemat & Ecol Anim, Siberian Branch, Novosibirsk, Russia; [Dudko, Roman Yu] Tomsk State Univ, Tomsk, Russia; [Kavanaugh, David H.] Calif Acad Sci, Dept Entomol, San Francisco, CA 94118 USA",sean.schoville@wisc.edu,130,0,0,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0305-0270,J BIOGEOGR,J.

However, 'resources' exclude the role of other-than-humans, thereby perpetuating asymmetrical and anthropocentric ways of knowing and conceptualizing place-based struggles. In the quest for distributive justice, the modern principle of sovereignty also goes unchallenged. Through an ethnographic observation of participatory mapping among the indigenous Gonds of Adilabad in South India, this Grassroots article shows that by incorporating other-than-human actors as equal agents of conservation, the Gonds have produced a non-sovereign, symmetrical map that challenges notions of human sovereignty over a seemingly inert 'nature.'

I draw on ecological research, historical documents, and my own ethnographic fieldwork to argue that we need a fuller understanding of both ginseng population demographics and the potential causes for ginseng decline, before we embrace a narrative that disenfranchises those who depend on and, in many cases, have helped steward this enigmatic plant. This research speaks to growing tensions between rural livelihoods and conservation efforts worldwide.","[Law, Justine] Sonoma State Univ, Hutchins Sch Liberal Studies, Ecol & Environm Studies, Rohnert Pk, CA 94928 USA",lawj@sonoma.edu,66,0,0,UNIV ARIZONA LIBRARIES,TUCSON,"UNIV ARIZONA LIBRARIES, TUCSON, AZ 85721 USA",1073-0451,J POLIT ECOL,J.

The interdependency of this biocultural knowledge and land management practice is still ecologically relevant today but is only recently being acknowledged in mainstream scientific conservation management processes and research. We present an example of cross-cultural collaborative management of the endangered monsoon vine thickets of the Dampier Peninsula, West Kimberley, northern Australia. These vine thickets occur as a network of over 80 patches in the lee of coastal dunes on the Peninsula, and are ecologically rich (containing 25% of Peninsula plant species) and culturally important for Peninsula Aboriginal groups for food, medicine, camping, cultural ceremonies and law. Adversely affected by land-clearing, weeds and wildfires, the vine thickets were listed as nationally endangered in 2013. The overlapping significance of the vine thickets by scientific and Aboriginal knowledge systems resulted in the formation of the Monsoon Vine Thicket Project in 2008 that aimed to document and conserve the ecosystem and its associated culture. The project has grown successfully over 13 years and has been guided by cross-cultural collaboration principles of respect for: cultural knowledge, practices and priorities; cultural knowledge holders; and long-term partnerships. The project has resulted in considerable outcomes in weed and fire management; seed collection, propagation and revegetation; community education; and the documentation, transfer and practice of Aboriginal biocultural knowledge. The greatest challenge for the project has been to better prioritise cultural activities, with examples provided of how this can increase benefits to both ecological conservation and cultural maintenance. The project's strength was its cross-cultural approach and resultant respectful and trusting relationships that allowed for project flexibility and adaptation and for the collaborative partners to learn and develop capacity. The integration of cultural and scientific knowledge and practice resulted in greater conservation outcomes for monsoon vine thickets of the Dampier Peninsula, and we believe is an important cross-cultural model for ecosystem management elsewhere in Australia.","[Lindsay, Malcolm; Beames, Louise] Kimberley Nat Proj Environs Kimberley, 44 Blackman St,POB 2281, Broome, WA 6725, Australia; [Yawuru Country Managers] Nyamba Buru Yawuru, Ranger Team, Broome, WA 6725, Australia; [Nyul Nyul Rangers] Nyul Nyul Aboriginal Corp, Ranger Team, Beagle Bay, WA 6725, Australia; [Bardi Jawi Rangers] Bardi & Jawi Niimidiman Aboriginal Corp, Ranger Team, Ardyaloon, WA 6725, Australia",malcolm@environskimberley.org.au,48,2,2,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1442-7001,ECOL MANAG RESTOR,Ecol.

Especially for animal species in fragmented landscapes, preservation of gene flow becomes a high priority target in order to restore genetic diversity and prevent local extinction. Within Central Europe, the Alps represent the core distribution area of the black grouse, Lyrurus tetrix. At its easternmost Alpine range, events of subpopulation extinction have already been documented in the past decades. Molecular data combined with spatial analyses can help to assess landscape effects on genetic variation and therefore can be informative for conservation management. Here, we addressed whether the genetic pattern of the easternmost Alpine black grouse metapopulation system is driven by isolation by distance or isolation by resistance. Correlative ecological niche modeling was used to assess geographic distances and landscape resistances. We then applied regression-based approaches combined with population genetic analyses based on microsatellite data to disentangle effects of isolation by distance and isolation by resistance among individuals and subpopulations. Although population genetic analyses revealed overall low levels of genetic differentiation, the ecological niche modeling showed subpopulations to be clearly delimited by habitat structures. Spatial genetic variation could be attributed to effects of isolation by distance among individuals and isolation by resistance among subpopulations, yet unknown effects might factor in. The easternmost subpopulation was the most differentiated, and at the same time, immigration was not detected; hence, its long-term survival might be threatened. Our study provides valuable insights into the spatial genetic variation of this small-scale metapopulation system of Alpine black grouse.","[Kunz, Florian; Sittenthaler, Marcia; Hacklaender, Klaus; Nopp-Mayr, Ursula] Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci, Inst Wildlife Biol & Game Management, Dept Integrat Biol & Biodivers Res, Gregor Mendel Str 33, A-1180 Vienna, Austria; [Klinga, Peter] Tech Univ Zvolen, Fac Forestry, Zvolen, Slovakia; [Klinga, Peter] DIANA Carpathian Wildlife Res, Banska Bystrica, Slovakia; [Sittenthaler, Marcia] Nat Hist Museum Vienna, Cent Res Labs, Vienna, Austria; [Schebeck, Martin; Stauffer, Christian] Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci, Inst Forest Entomol Forest Pathol & Forest Protec, Dept Forest & Soil Sci, Vienna, Austria; [Gruenschachner-Berger, Veronika] Off Wildlife Biol & Management, Mariazell, Austria; [Hacklaender, Klaus] German Wildlife Fdn, Hamburg, Germany",florian.kunz@boku.ac.at,109,0,0,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

The first step of the framework is to determine the protection targets. In this study, the protection targets were defined as important habitats and important ecosystems. The second step is to identify the PAs plans of different sizes. We adopted a SCP method, which takes into account costeffectiveness while delineating the PAs. The third step is to determine the optimal size of the PAs through ecological protection efficiency analysis. We constructed the protection efficiency index (PEI), which is the protection cost per unit area. Then we used Kaya identity (a structural decomposition method) to decompose PEI. The decomposed PEI included value density (ecological value per unit area) and value cost (cost to realize unit ecological value). By analyzing the changes of the two, the optimal size of the PAs can be determined. We took Nanchang as an example to conduct an empirical study to verify the usability of the TPD framework. The result shows the TPD framework proposed in this study can effectively identify the optimal size of PAs and contribute to forming a cost-effective ecological protection plan. When the size of PAs was set to 70% of the important habitats and important ecosystems, it was most beneficial for ecological protection. Furthermore, the optimal protection efficiency plan recommended by the TPD framework improved the efficiency of ecological protection. The TPD framework can serve as a basis for the size identification of PAs and also support the delineation of PAs worldwide.","[Yu, Chaoyue; Gao, Yang; Lu, Qingling] China Agr Univ, Coll Land Sci & Technol, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China; [Wang, Chenxu; Chen, Tianqian] Beijing Normal Univ, Fac Geog Sci, State Key Lab Earth Surface Proc & Resource Ecol, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China; [Wang, Jiabin] China Univ Geosci, Sch Land Sci & Technol, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China",yanggao@cau.edu.cn,75,0,0,ACADEMIC PRESS LTD- ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,LONDON,"24-28 OVAL RD, LONDON NW1 7DX, ENGLAND",0301-4797,J ENVIRON MANAGE,J.

Environmental policies emphasize stakeholder engagement in decision-making, yet landscape conservation is typically a bureaucratic-scientific endeavour. Building trusting relationships with stakeholders is key to negotiations that minimize trade-offs and maximize synergies. Incorporating shared stakeholder objectives improves co-management, as they act as incentives for participation and trust development. We explored the degree of alignment between the bottom-up stakeholder objectives and top-down management objectives of a landscape-scale conservation initiative on the West Coast of South Africa. We categorized stakeholders into six affiliations representing governmental, private and community organizations, and using a social-ecological inventory we identified ten shared objectives. Of these objectives, three were shared between all affiliations, namely biodiversity conservation, socioeconomic development and coordination of the landscape approach. The first two aligned with the top-down landscape management objectives and the latter did not. The importance of coordinating landscape approaches in multi-stakeholder landscape-scale initiatives is crucial to long-term success, and we recommend that it be formally included as a landscape management objective. Exploring the alignment between bottom-up and top-down objectives can highlight overlooked functions of co-management and can reduce the transaction costs of sustaining conservation efforts in the long term.","[Mc Culloch-Jones, Samantha; Novellie, Peter; Roux, Dirk J.; Currie, Bianca] Nelson Mandela Univ, Sustainabil Res Unit, ZA-6530 George, South Africa; [Roux, Dirk J.] South African Natl Pk, Sci Serv, ZA-6530 George, South Africa",samantha.mcculloch@mandela.ac.za,45,0,0,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0376-8929,ENVIRON CONSERV,Environ.

Here, we investigated the ecological value of intermittent rivers for terrestrial vertebrates by installing camera traps along rivers subject to varying dry periods in two contrasting European climatic zones. We then analysed i) species presence and behaviours (as a proxy of ecological functions) on perennial and intermittent streams; ii) environmental (hydrological and geomorphological) and anthropogenic factors affecting the frequency of occurrence and number of species recorded; and iii) the importance of hydrological factors as regards ecological functioning. In both study areas, we recorded a higher number of species and individuals along intermittent streams than perennial streams, with highest values in intermittent reaches exhibiting shorter dry periods. Both abundance and species richness were strongly affected by hydrological factors in both study areas, including not only the occurrence but also the duration of the dry period. Dry channels played a key role as migration corridors and as a source of food, being used more frequently than riparian habitats when the river ran dry. Our findings indicate that terrestrial vertebrate fauna benefit from dry phases in rivers. Intermittent rivers, supporting a high abundance and diversity of fauna, should be considered as target ecosystems for wildlife conservation. Not doing so will jeopardise urgently needed conservation strategies in the face of accelerating global climate change. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

This paper is a synthesis of 71 case studies of mountain-specific SES, submitted to the International Partnership for the Satoyama Initiative (IPSI) that identifies major drivers of change, associated impacts, and response strategies. We find that overexploitation, land use change, demographic change, and the regional economy are the most prevalent drivers of change in the IPSI mountain SES, leading to negative consequences for biodiversity, livelihoods, indigenous knowledge, and culture. To counter these challenges in the study SES, stakeholders from the public, private, and civil society sectors have been implementing diverse legal, behavioral, cognitive, technological, and economic response strategies, often with strong community participation.

Despite stark gender inequality challenges in many regions of the world, women can and do play a fundamental role in conservation initiatives in rural and other communities. However, examples of women's involvement in conservation initiatives, notably in Latin America, are limited in the literature. We conducted interview-based research to learn more about the role that a women-led group named the Asociacion de Desarrollo Comunal de Mujeres de la Barra de Santiago (AMBAS) - plays in sea turtle and other conservation initiatives in an artisanal fishing community in rural El Salvador. We identified four major themes from interview and survey responses (1. gender challenges; 2. interest in helping the environment; 3. local ecological knowledge; 4. community perceptions) that underscore the value of incorporating women's ecological knowledge into conservation efforts while also drawing attention to the continued challenges that women face in environmental decision making. These data also suggest that conservation strategies that provide both environmental and economic benefits can inspire conservation commitment, regardless of whether they are led by men or women. This study contributes to the nascent dataset of examples highlighting the essential roles of women in conservation, and reinforces the notion that multi-gender participation is essential to maximise positive impact in conservation and wildlife recovery.","[Massey, Lynn M.; Camerden, Prestyn McCord] Scripps Inst Oceanog, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Massey, Lynn M.] NOAA, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Long Beach, CA 90802 USA; [Camerden, Prestyn McCord] Los Cerritos Wetlands Stewards, Long Beach, CA USA; [Gaos, Alexander R.] NOAA, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Marine Turtle Biol & Assessment Program, Pacific Isl Fisheries Sci Ctr, Honolulu, HI USA; [Liles, Michael J.] Assoc ProCosta, San Salvador, El Salvador; [Seminoff, Jeffrey A.] NOAA, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Marine Turtle Ecol & Assessment Program, Southwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, La Jolla, CA USA; [Ahern, Ana Luisa M.] EcoViva, Columbus, GA USA",lynn.massey@noaa.gov,79,0,0,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-9839,LOCAL ENVIRON,Local Environ.,2022,,

We review the scientific developments achieved in this region, and outline promising research avenues enhancing conservation. Some of these discoveries indicate that the Macaronesian flora and fauna are composed of rather young lineages, not Tertiary relicts, predominantly of European origin. Macaronesia also seems to be an important source region for back-colonisation of continental fringe regions on both sides of the Atlantic. This group of archipelagos (Azores, Madeira, Selvagens, Canary Islands, and Cabo Verde) has been crucial to learn about the particularities of macroecological patterns and interaction networks on islands, providing evidence for the development of the General Dynamic Model of oceanic island biogeography and subsequent updates. However, in addition to exceptionally high richness of endemic species, Macaronesia is also home to a growing number of threatened species, along with invasive alien plants and animals. Several innovative conservation and management actions are in place to protect its biodiversity from these and other drivers of global change. The Macaronesian Islands are a well-suited field of study for island ecology and evolution research, mostly due to its special geological layout with 40 islands grouped within five archipelagos differing in geological age, climate and isolation. A large amount of data is now available for several groups of organisms on and around many of these islands.

They are subject to high levels of threat, with 72% of the 94 assessed species falling into one of the threatened Red List categories, as a consequence of habitat degradation of seasonal wetlands. There is, therefore, a need to conserve ephemeral waters for species that rely on the seasonality of habitats. Extinction risk factors for all species of the genus were entirely reworked with IUCN Red List assessments, whereas first-time assessments were established for species that had previously not been evaluated. These fishes complete their seasonal life cycle in ephemeral natural habitats and this makes them highly vulnerable, as such wetland habitats are often degraded owing to multiple interacting human-induced stressors and threats, including cultivation of wetlands for agriculture, abstraction of water, expansion of urban areas and pollution load. A fine-scale classification scheme based on habitat type was used for each site to identify ecological characteristics and the pattern of threats. The classification scheme is based on a primary subdivision of natural habitats compared with those modified by human activities, with further subdivision within the two fundamental groupings. Out of the 478 analysed habitat site observations by the authors, 46% were affected by human activities. Recommended conservation actions include: conducting surveys to better understand habitat trends and threats; establishing protected areas and effectively allocating resources to preserve wetland habitats; managing protection of the structural integrity of the habitats throughout the seasonal phases of wet and dry seasons; and raising awareness of the importance of healthy wetland systems and the value of the unique seasonal freshwater biodiversity.","[Nagy, Bela] 30 Rue Mt Ussy, F-77300 Fontainebleau, France",bela.nagy@neuf.fr,53,0,0,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1052-7613,AQUAT CONSERV,Aquat.

Accomplishing this ambitious goal in the U.S. requires understanding the relative contribution of public and private lands toward supporting biodiversity. New approaches are needed because existing approaches focus on quantity of habitat without incorporating quality. To fill this need, we developed a 30 m resolution national habitat condition index (HCI) that integrates quality and quantity measures of habitat. We hypothesized that including an evaluation of the quality of habitat at landscape scales, both in conservation-focused preserves and working lands would provide a better assessment of the value of geographies for conservation. We divided the conterminous U.S. by major land cover type and into natural and cultivated lands and then spatially mapped multiple anthropogenic stressors, proximity to aquatic habitat, and vegetation departure from expected natural disturbance regimes. Each map layer was then scored for site impact and distance decay and combined into a final national index. Field observations providing scored relative ecological conditions were used for HCI calibration and validation at both CONUS and regional scales. Finally, we evaluate lands by management (conservation versus working lands) and ownership (public versus private) testing the value of these lands for conservation. While we found regional differences across CONUS, functional habitat was largely independent of protection status: working lands provide clear habitat and other values. These results are relevant for guiding strategies to achieve the U.S. 30 by 30 goals.

In the Neotropics, the global hotspot of avian diversity, only six 100-ha plots, all located in lowland forests of Amazonia, the Guianan shield and Panama, have been inventoried sufficiently. We review the most important lessons learned about Neotropical forest bird communities from those big bird plots and explore opportunities for creating a more extensive network of additional plots to address questions in ecology and conservation, following the model of the existing ForestGEO network of tree plots. Scholarly impact of the big bird plot papers has been extensive, with the papers accumulating nearly 1,500 citations, particularly on topics of tropical ecology, avian conservation, and community organization. Comparisons of results from the plot surveys show no single methodological scheme works effectively for surveying abundances of all bird species at all sites; multiple approaches have been utilized and must be employed in the future. On the existing plots, abundance patterns varied substantially between the South American plots and the Central American one, suggesting different community structuring mechanisms are at work and that additional sampling across geographic space is needed. Total bird abundance in Panama, dominated by small insectivores, was double that of Amazonia and the Guianan plateau, which were dominated by large granivores and frugivores. The most common species in Panama were three times more abundant than those in Amazonia, whereas overall richness was 1.5 times greater in Amazonia. Despite these differences in community structure, other basic information, including uncertainty in population density estimates, has yet to be quantified. Results from existing plots may inform drivers of differences in community structure and create baselines for detection of long-term regional changes in bird abundances, but supplementation of the small number of plots is needed to increase generalizability of results and reveal the texture of geographic variation. We propose fruitful avenues of future research based on our current synthesis of the big bird plots. Collaborating with the large network of ForestGEO tree plots could be one approach to improve understanding of linkages between plant and bird diversity. Careful quantification of bird survey effort, recording of exact locations of survey routes or stations, and archiving detailed metadata will greatly enhance the value of benchmark data for future repeat surveys of the existing plots and initial surveys of newly established plots.","[Robinson, W.

It is expected that protected areas, the cornerstone of biodiversity conservation efforts, will assume a decisive role in protecting freshwater species from the impacts of climate change. This study assessed the effects of climate change on migratory fish of the second largest neotropical river basin, evaluating the effectiveness of protected areas in safeguarding fish species, and hence the ecological functions that they perform and the ecosystem resources that they provide. The present range of 23 migratory fish of economic interest in the Parana-Paraguay basin was estimated and the responses to future climatic shifts projected to the middle and end of the 21st century were examined, quantifying predictive uncertainties. Changes and losses of climatically suitable areas will trigger severe contractions in range, with the greatest impact on the most valuable species in commercial fishing, where range losses are likely to surpass 65% in the future. The main channel of the Upper Parana River and tributaries of its left margin are projected to serve as climatic refuges for many species, and such regions are not affected by high predictive uncertainty. The results revealed that protected areas do not sufficiently protect migratory fish at present, and that they will continue to offer negligible protection in the face of climate change. This study alerts decision makers to the potential damage to inland fishery resources from climate change and provides useful information to guide conservation strategies spatially. We advocate that the creation of new protected areas and the redesign of the existing network to encompass regions that maximize current and future occupancy of migratory fish are crucial to conserve the valuable ecological, societal, and economic benefits that they provide.","[Bailly, Dayani; da Graca, Weferson Junio; de Oliveira, Anielly Galego; Agostinho, Angelo Antonio] Univ Estadual Maringa UEM, Programa Posgrad Ecol Ambientes Aquat Continentai, Maringa, Parana, Brazil; [Batista-Silva, Valeria Flavia] Univ Estadual Mato Grosso Sul UEMS, Mundo Novo, Mato Grosso Do, Brazil; [Silva Cassemiro, Fernanda A.; Rangel, Thiago Fernando] Univ Fed Goias UFG, Programa Posgrad Ecol & Evolucao, Goiania, Go, Brazil; [Lemes, Priscila] Univ Fed Mato Grosso UFMT, Dept Bot & Ecol, Cuiaba, Mato Grosso, Brazil; [do Couto, Edivando Vitor; Delconte Ferreira, Jose Hilario; Re, Reginaldo] Univ Tecnol Fed Parana UTFPR, Campo Mourao, Parana, Brazil",dayanibailly@gmail.com,102,2,2,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1052-7613,AQUAT CONSERV,Aquat.

To do so, we compiled three independent datasets on vulture occurrence from road-surveys, GPS-tracking, and citizen science (eBird), and used maximum entropy to build ensemble species distribution models (SDMs). We then identified spatial vulture conservation priorities in Ethiopia, a stronghold for vultures in Africa, while accounting for uncertainty in our predictions. We were able to build robust distribution models for five vulture species across the entirety of Ethiopia, including three Critically Endangered, one Endangered, and one Near Threatened species. We show that priorities occur in the highlands of Ethiopia, which provide particularly important habitat for Bearded Gypaetus barbatus, Hooded Necrosyrtes monachus, Ruppell's Gyps ruppelli and White-backed Gyps africanus Vultures, as well as the lowlands of north-eastern Ethiopia, which are particularly valuable for the Egyptian Vulture Neophron percnopterus. One-third of the core distribution of the Egyptian Vulture was protected, followed by the White-backed Vulture at one-sixth, and all other species at one-tenth. Overall, only about one-fifth of vulture priority areas were protected. Given that there is limited protection of priority areas and that vultures range widely, we argue that measures of broad spatial and legislative scope will be necessary to address drivers of vulture declines, including poisoning, energy infrastructure, and climate change, while considering the local social context and aiding sustainable development.","[Buechley, Evan R.] HawkWatch Int, 2240 South 900 East, Salt Lake City, UT 84106 USA; [Buechley, Evan R.; Neate-Clegg, Montague H.

Understanding if thresholds of forest cover exist beyond which biodiversity displays non-linear declines is key to developing appropriate conservation strategies and policies, but uncertainty remains around the identification and characteristics of these thresholds. We performed a global systematic review of studies using forest cover gradient to identify an ecological threshold across tropical forest ecosystems. Our systematic review finds 68 ecological thresholds reported in 33 peer-reviewed publications. Three main conclusions emerged: first, we show clear geographical gaps in ecological thresholds studies, with 72% of reported thresholds found in South America, over half in Brazil; second, we see ecological threshold studies follow taxonomic biases in line with wider conservation research; and third, there is a lack of homogeneity and comparability in the metrics and sampling designs used to identify a threshold. This global review shows interest in ecological thresholds continues to grow, but further evidence is needed to understand their application in tropical forest management. We identify the main gaps in knowledge and provide guidance to focus research efforts on six key aspects to better understand their potential as a policy-making tool for tropical forest conservation.

Recent estimates find an 80% population reduction occurred between 1990 and 2014. Further, 83% of these chimpanzees are estimated to live outside any high-level protected area. Ivory Coast's drastic chimpanzee decline, within a commercial agriculture setting, has much inspired this new protected area-centered action plan. We discuss two contrasting mechanisms contributing to population decline within Ivory Coast in order to assess their relevance to address range-wide conservation issues. We then consider the role of rotational agriculture, which dominates the subsistence economy of neighboring countries, as either a threat or a part of the solution to this subspecies' conservation. We identify knowledge gaps in three critical areas. First, little is known about the habitat types that have experienced the greatest losses across the range of the western chimpanzee. Second, relatively little is known about chimpanzee use of fallowed agricultural fields. Finally, little is known about farmer's ecological knowledge about chimpanzees and their potential to coexist. Establishing new protected areas over the next decade will likely be as an offset to areas used in infrastructure development, implying that ever larger areas will be lost to subsistence farming. We propose to broaden conservation plans for the western chimpanzee. Specifically, we call for deeper consideration of habitat sharing of agricultural fallows within subsistence agricultural landscapes as a means to foster human-chimpanzee coexistence. A focus on coexistence could help mitigate conservation-subsistence farming conflicts.","[Leblan, Vincent] Sorbonne Univ, Inst Rech Dev, Museum Natl Hist Nat, Patrimoines Locaux Environm & Globalisat PALOC, Paris, France; [Leblan, Vincent] Univ Felix Houphouet Boigny, Inst Sci Anthropol Dev ISAD, Abidjan, Cote Ivoire; [Soiret, Serge Pacome Keagnon] Ctr Suisse Rech Sci Cote dIvoire CSRS, Adiopodoume, Cote Ivoire; [Soiret, Serge Pacome Keagnon] Univ Felix Houphouet Boigny, Lab Zool & Biol Anim, Abidjan, Cote Ivoire",vincent.leblan@ird.fr,31,0,0,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",,CONSERV SCI PRACT,Conserv.

Cryptic ongoing hybridization can add further uncertainty and could be beneficial or destructive. Here, we show that a declining birch tree species is hybridizing with a more widespread relative in the Junggar basin, NW China, and their hybrids have been previously named as rare sub-species. Given the declining numbers of this birch tree, we suggest that conservation effort should aim to slow the rate of anthropogenic habitat loss at this hybrid zone and preserve its pure populations away from the hybrid zone. In areas where closely related species meet, the possibility that they may hybridize must be taken into account by conservationists. Hybridization may have positive or negative consequences for the long-term future of species. If present, its dynamics need to be understood. Betula microphylla is a declining wetland tree species in NW China that forms a continuum of leaf morphology and geographic distribution with its relative Betula tianshanica. We use ecological niche models to predict the distribution of B. microphylla and B. tianshanica. We use restriction site-associated DNA sequencing and SSRs to resolve their genetic structure and patterns of allele sharing. Ecological niche models predict an expansion of the range of B. tianshanica into that of B. microphylla since the Last Glacial Maximum and the contraction of B. microphylla's range in the future. Genetic data suggest that the two species have hybridized in the Junggar basin and in the Tianshan Mountains where the two species have co-occurred in the recent past and in the Altay Mountains where there are no records of B. tianshanica occurrence. Rare populations previously identified as sub-species of B. microphylla were shown to be of hybrid origin. Further research is needed on the costs and benefits of hybridization between B. microphylla and B. tianshanica in the changing environment of NW China. Our current data suggest that conservation effort should aim to slow the rate of anthropogenic habitat loss at the hybrid zone in the Junggar basin and preserve pure populations far away from the hybrid zone in the Altay Mountains.","[Ding, Junyi; Wang, Luwei; Wang, Feifei; Wang, Nian] Shandong Agr Univ, State Forestry & Grassland Adm Key Lab Silvicultu, Coll Forestry, Tai An 271018, Shandong, Peoples R China; [Ding, Junyi; Wang, Luwei; Wang, Feifei; Wang, Nian] Shandong Agr Univ, Coll Forestry, Mt Tai Forest Ecosyst Res Stn State Forestry & Gr, Tai An, Shandong, Peoples R China; [Hua, Donglai] Xinjiang Acad Agr & Reclamat Sci, Shihezi, Peoples R China; [Hua, Donglai] Shihezi Univ, Coll Life Sci, Shihezi, Peoples R China; [Borrell, James S.; Buggs, Richard J.

MPAs are established around the world using a wide range of legislative instruments and thus come in a variety of forms and shapes. Despite being regarded as the cornerstone of global marine conservation efforts, they currently cover less than 10% of the ocean surface. Individual MPAs aim to achieve goals ranging from the protection of specific habitats or species to sustaining certain commercial activities, such as fishing. By default, the establishment of MPAs intertwines social, ecological and economic considerations. Yet, the emphasis put on each of these domains can vary substantially when setting on-the-ground objectives, frequently creating conflict among stakeholders. In this manuscript, we first discuss current international conservation targets as well as potential future goals and delve into the question of how to assess the effectiveness of MPAs. Subsequently, we discuss the ambivalent role of this widely applied management tool at the crossroads between biodiversity conservation and fisheries management. Placing MPAs in a social-ecological framework, we call for clear and measurable goals to evaluate MPAs from an interdisciplinary perspective. Finally, we present the Baltic Sea, with its high degree of anthropogenic impact, long fishing history and comparatively extensive MPA coverage, as an interesting case study to investigate the role of MPAs in promoting a sustainable management of the ocean.","[Kriegl, Michael; von Dorrien, Christian; Oesterwind, Daniel] Thunen Inst Balt Sea Fisheries, Rostock, Germany; [Kriegl, Michael] Leibniz Ctr Trop Marine Res, ZMT, Bremen, Germany; [Ilosvay, Xochitl E.

The framework presented provides a roadmap for the development of integrated vulnerability assessments that are robust, context-specific, and relevant to the management of SES.","[Thiault, Lauric; Claudet, Joachim] PSL Univ Paris, Natl Ctr Sci Res, CRIOBE, Maison Oceans,USR CNRS EPHE UPVD 3278, Paris, France; [Thiault, Lauric; Claudet, Joachim] CORAIL, Lab Excellence CORAIL, Moorea, French Polynesi, France; [Thiault, Lauric] Moana Ecol, Rocbaron, France; [Jupiter, Stacy D.] Wildlife Conservat Soc, Melanesia Program, Suva, Fiji; [Johnson, Johanna E.] C2O Coasts Climate Oceans, Port Vila, Vanuatu; [Johnson, Johanna E.] James Cook Univ, Coll Marine & Environm Sci, Cairns, Qld, Australia; [Cinner, Joshua E.; Heron, Scott F.] James Cook Univ, Australian Res Council Ctr Excellence Coral Reef, Townsville, Qld, Australia; [Jarvis, Rebecca M.] Auckland Univ Technol, Sch Sci, Auckland, Aotearoa, New Zealand; [Heron, Scott F.] James Cook Univ, Phys & Marine Geophys Lab, Townsville, Qld, Australia; [Maina, Joseph M.] Macquarie Univ, Fac Sci & Engn, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Marshall, Nadine A.] James Cook Univ, CSIRO Land & Water, Townsville, Qld, Australia; [Marshall, Paul A.] James Cook Univ, Ctr Trop Water & Aquat Ecosyst Res, Townsville, Qld, Australia; [Marshall, Paul A.] NEOM, Environm Dept, Sharma, Saudi Arabia",,155,4,4,RESILIENCE ALLIANCE,WOLFVILLE,"ACADIA UNIV, BIOLOGY DEPT, WOLFVILLE, NS B0P 1X0, CANADA",1708-3087,ECOL SOC,Ecol.

The philosophies that underpin and shape traditional conservation initiatives have begun to shift toward a people and nature approach, based on a new and deeper understanding of relational values. With this shift, there is increasing concern about the social impacts of conservation anda need to consider not only the environmental aspects of conservation, but also issues of equity and social justice. This is especially important for marine conservation to avoid repeating the exclusionary and unjust protective measures sometimes seen in traditional terrestrial conservation. Additionally, lack of compliance with management schemes, and failure to consider the social dimensions and realities of local communities have hindered the success of conservation initiatives. Therefore, increasing engagement with social science and a better understanding of humanwildlife and human-nature connections are necessary. Community-based conservation approaches and payment for ecosystem service schemes can provide important insights and lessons for such improved participatory management. Furthermore, the use of social science offers a range of methods and approaches that can be used to improve the consideration of those social dimensions. These include different theoretical frameworks for understanding the relationships between people, society, and nature, innovative participatory methods and more flexible, adaptive systemsbased approaches for understanding complex socio-ecological systems. Increasing and mainstreaming the inclusion of the social dimensions of conservation will also depend on overcoming current institutional barriers such as lack of capacity, time, and funding opportunities especially in the context of marine social science.","[Sanborn, Thomas; Jung, Julia] Univ Ghent, Marine Biol Res Grp, Ghent, Belgium",thms.sanbom@gmail.com,107,1,1,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,FRONT MAR SCI,Front.

Jaguars have been extirpated from over half of their original distribution, and few regions still maintain large populations. The Pantanal is among the best examples of such regions and can be used to better understand several aspects of jaguar biology that are relevant for conservation planning throughout the species' range. Thus, in this study we used microsatellite markers and field data to: (i) assess the genetic structure and gene flow of jaguars (n = 110) from the northern and southern Pantanal; (ii) verify if females are more philopatric than males; (iii) produce a timeline pedigree to allow the identification of distances from offspring to their mothers; and (iv) estimate the generation time for jaguars. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that Pantanal jaguars represent a panmictic population, although exhibiting some degree of local differentiation. The Paraguay River seems to be an important factor promoting gene flow among the studied populations, highlighting its relevance for regional conservation efforts. Our data provide the first genetic evidence of female philopatry and male-biased dispersal in jaguars. In addition, we report the first timeline pedigree for a wild jaguar population and the first direct estimate of the species' generation time. Our results contribute to the construction of more realistic assessments of jaguar population dynamics and long-term genetic viability, thus contributing to the design of improved conservation strategies on behalf of this species.","[Kantek, Daniel Luis Zanella; Miyazaki, Selma Samiko] Inst Chico Mendes Conservacao Biodiversidade, Estacao Ecol Taiama, Caceres, Mato Grosso, Brazil; [Kantek, Daniel Luis Zanella; Trinca, Cristine Silveira; Eizirik, Eduardo] Pontificia Univ Catolica Rio Grande do Sul PUCRS, Lab Biol Genom & Mol, Escola Ciencias Saude & Vida, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil; [Tortato, Fernando; Devlin, Allison Loretta; May-Junior, Joares Adenilson] Panthera, New York, NY USA; [Devlin, Allison Loretta] SUNY Coll Environm Sci & Forestry, Syracuse, NY 13210 USA; [Devlin, Allison Loretta] Univ Montana, Wildlife Biol Program, WA Franke Coll Forestry & Conservat, Missoula, MT 59812 USA; [de Azevedo, Fernando Cesar Cascelli] Univ Fed Sao Joao del Rei, Sao Joao Del Rei, MG, Brazil; [de Azevedo, Fernando Cesar Cascelli; Cavalcanti, Sandra; May-Junior, Joares Adenilson; Eizirik, Eduardo] Inst Pro Carnivoros, Atibaia, SP, Brazil; [Silveira, Leandro] Inst Onca Pintada, Mineiros, Go, Brazil; [Crawshaw Junior, Peter Gransden; Morato, Ronaldo Goncalves] Inst Chico Mendes Conservacao Biodiversidade, Ctr Nacl Pesquisa & Conservacao Mamiferos Carnivo, Atibaia, SP, Brazil; [May-Junior, Joares Adenilson; Fragoso, Carlos Eduardo; Sartorello, Leonardo Rodrigues; Rampim, Lilian Elaine; Haberfeld, Mario B.] Assoc Oncafari, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil; [May-Junior, Joares Adenilson] Univ Sul Santa Catarina Unisul, Tubarao, SC, Brazil; [Crawshaw Junior, Peter Gransden; de Araujo, Gediendson Ribeiro] Univ Fed Mato Grosso do Sul, Campo Grande, MS, Brazil; [Eizirik, Eduardo] INCT EECBio, Goiania, Go, Brazil",eduardo.eizirik@pucrs.br,75,2,2,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0006-3207,BIOL CONSERV,Biol.

In this study, fish diversity presences were linked to abiotic conditions and different habitat types to reveal multi-species and hotspots models predicted by ecological niche modelling methods within the Bay of La Paz, Mexico (south of Gulf of California). The abiotically suitable areas for 217 fish species were identified based on historical (1975-2020) presence data sets and a set of environmental layers related to distances from mangroves and rocky shores habitats, marine substrate, and bottom geomorphology conditions. Hotspot model distribution was delineated from a multi-species model identifying areas with >= 60 species per hectare and was compared to the marine conservation areas such Balandra Protected Natural Area (BPNA), illustrating how these models can be applied to improve the local regulatory framework. The results indicate that (1) there is a need for the BPNA to be enlarged to capture more of the delineated hotspot areas, and thus an update to the management plan will be required, (2) new conservation areas either adjacent or outside of the established BPNA should be established, or (3) Ramsar sites or other priority areas should be subject to legal recognition and a management plan decreed so that these vital habitats and fish diversity can be better protected.","[Urcadiz-Cazares, Francisco Javier; Gonzalez-Pelaez, Sergio Scarry] Ctr Invest Biol Noroeste, Ecol Pesquera, Ave Inst Politecn Nacl 195, La Paz 23090, Baja Calif Sur, Mexico; [Urcadiz-Cazares, Francisco Javier] Tecnol Nacl Mexico, Dept Ciencias Basicas, Campus La Paz,Blvd Forjadores Baja Calif Sur 4720, La Paz 23080, Baja Calif Sur, Mexico; [Cruz-Escalona, Victor Hugo; Del Pino-Machado, Arturo; Enriquez-Garcia, Arturo Bell; Borges-Souza, Jose Manuel] Inst Politecn Nacl, Dept Pesquerias & Biol Marina, Ctr Interdisciplinario Ciencias Marinas, Ave Inst Politecn Nacl S-N, La Paz 23096, Baja Calif Sur, Mexico; [Peterson, Mark S.] Univ Southern Mississippi, Sch Ocean Sci & Engn, Div Coastal Sci, 703 East Beach Dr, Ocean Springs, MS 39564 USA; [Aguilar-Medrano, Rosalia] CINVESTAV Merida, Dept Recursos Mar, Lab Taxon & Ecol Peces, Km 6 Antigua Carretera Progreso, Merida 97310, Yucatan, Mexico; [Marin-Enriquez, Emigdio] CONACYT Univ Autonoma Sinaloa, Fac Ciencias Mar, Paseo Claussen S-N, Mazatlan 8200, Sinaloa, Mexico; [Ortega-Rubio, Alfredo] Ctr Invest Biol Noroeste, Planeac Ambiental & Conservac, Ave Inst Politecn Nacl 195, La Paz 23090, Baja Calif Sur, Mexico",urcadiz@me.com; vescalon@ipn.mx; mark.peterson@usm.edu; liabiol@gmail.com; emarin@uas.edu.mx; scarry04@cibnor.mx; arturodelpino2@gmail.com; arturo.bell.eg@gmail.com; jborges@ipn.mx; aortega@cibnor.mx,79,0,0,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,DIVERSITY-BASEL,Diversity-Basel,2021,gold,

Urban wildlife conservation research and policy has importantly furthered ecological understanding and species protection in cities, while also leveraging wildlife conservation to connect people to urban nature. Thus, urban wildlife conservation intersects conservation research, conservation policy, and the general public in cities worldwide. Yet, species that are often framed as urban wildlife are often of higher trophic levels, including birds and mammals that serve as flagship species for public support. Other forms of urban life including plants and invertebrates are often largely ignored, producing a normative urban wildlife concept that may bias urban wildlife conservation research and policy, and sentiment in the general public. To develop new strategies in urban wildlife conservation for the urban era, we need to move towards a more inclusive and holistic framing of urban wildlife for both research and the public. In this article, we discuss the normative framing of urban wildlife and how this framing may bias urban conservation efforts, and argue for a holistic approach to urban wildlife inclusive of all life forms for future research, publicity and policy interventions.","[Egerer, Monika] Tech Univ Munich, Sch Life Sci, Hans Carl von Carlowitz Pl 2, D-85354 Freising Weihenstephan, Germany; [Egerer, Monika; Buchholz, Sascha] Tech Univ Berlin, Dept Ecol, D-12165 Berlin, Germany; [Buchholz, Sascha] Berlin Brandenburg Inst Adv Biodivers Res BBIB, D-14195 Berlin, Germany",monika.egerer@tum.de; sascha.buchholz@tu-berlin.de,35,0,0,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0960-3115,BIODIVERS CONSERV,Biodivers.

For birds, there are four widely used global checklists that vary in length and application. Here, we investigate the biogeographical and ecological predictors of taxonomic disagreement between the four world bird species lists. Location Global. Time period Present. Major taxa studied Birds. Methods We determined taxonomic agreement based on whether each bird species name represented only one species ('agreement'), that is, no authorities have split the species, or represented multiple species ('disagreement') including disputed splits recognised by some authorities. We examined taxonomic agreement for all birds and for each family and biogeographical region. We then modelled taxonomic agreement as a function of six biogeographical and ecological variables: latitude, island endemism, log(mass), forest dependency, primary diet, and migratory status. Results Overall taxonomic agreement was 89.5%, and the remaining 10th of taxonomic names represented disputed splits upon which the four authorities disagreed. We found that taxonomic agreement was lowest for species in Southeast Asia/Australasia and the Southern Ocean, understudied regions where islands have driven high levels of cryptic diversification. In contrast, agreement was highest in the temperate Northern Hemisphere where diversity is lower and research is more extensive. Agreement was also higher for large, migratory species living in open habitats. Main conclusions Taxonomic agreement was higher for species that are easier to study such as large, temperate species from open habitats. In addition, agreement was lower for lineages that are more likely to undergo cryptic divergence such as island endemics with intermediate forest dependency and mobility. Species with these traits should be the focus of taxonomic research in order to achieve reconciliation of the world's bird lists and to better conserve extant biodiversity.","[Neate-Clegg, Montague H.

However, data about species turnover-and especially complementarity in the functional composition-across neighbouring habitat types from natural communities are rare. We studied frog communities in lowland rainforest in Malaysian Borneo and compared the species composition and functional-trait composition of different habitat types (alluvial forest, limestone forest, kerangas). Forest types differed strongly in their species composition and, to a lesser extent, in their functional-trait composition. We also compared functional-trait combinations of frogs directly across the forest types and identified six clusters of functionally similar species: three were found in all forest types, the others were absent from at least one forest type. The complementarity in species and functional-trait composition between the forest resulted in high regional gamma diversity, and most of this regional functional diversity was unique to individual forest types. Moreover, the strict separation in species composition suggests that even functionally similar frog species from different forest types cannot easily replace each other in case of local extinctions. The maintenance of ecological functions fulfilled by frogs on the landscape scale therefore requires the conservation of all forest-specific frog communities. ? 2021 The Author(s).

We also implemented ecological niche modelling to determine the potential range of the fungus. More than half of H. flagellum records (57%) were found in high conservation value areas, on fallen trunks of silver fir trees. The basidiomata were predominantly recorded between August and late November. Distribution of the tree host, precipitation in the driest month, isothermality and annual mean temperature were the most decisive factors influencing H. flagellum occurrence.

Existing evidence on the link between ecological knowledge and psychological nature connection is mixed, geographically limited to countries in the Global North, and does not scrutinise potential differences in determinants of ecological knowledge and nature connection. We investigate the relationship between psychological nature connection and ecological knowledge of local bird species, and assess their associations with potential drivers, including access to, contact with, and reliance on nature and socio-demographic characteristics. Our study is carried among a novel participant population of colonist farmers living along a major deforestation frontier in the Brazilian Amazon. Our study context has high conservation relevance and provides an ideal setting to assess the extent to which conservation psychology's insights from the Global North hold true elsewhere. Tropical farm-forest frontiers suffer from intense habitat and biodiversity loss, and farmers with migrant origins are important yet rarely studied conservation stakeholders. Importantly, farmers' experiences of nature are likely to vary considerably due to the wide range of socio-demographic, economic, geographical and cultural diversity. Interviewees scored highly on two indices of nature connection, but scores were higher among older people and those with greater contact with nature. Bird identification knowledge was generally low to moderate, and higher among men and younger people. Species more frequently recognised were regionally common, larger-bodied or associated with non-forest habitats. Ecological knowledge of birds and nature connection were not correlated, and they did not have any predictors in common. Our results indicate that colonist farmers are capable of forming strong connections with nature, even if they rarely possess detailed knowledge of local forest biodiversity. Considering the complex and apparently context-dependent relationship between knowing and caring about nature, it is unwise to assume that changing one would automatically affect the other.

SPAs are useful for a wide range of species that are amenable to cultivation. Despite increasing research on SPAs, their value for biodiversity conservation has yet to be comprehensively described. Here, we highlight the key benefits of SPAs to biodiversity conservation. First, SPAs allow restoration to be conducted on a much greater scale than could be accomplished with wildland-harvested seed, thus protecting key biodiversity assets from harvest pressures. Second, the native seed production industry adds to the base of stakeholders who are invested in restoring and enhancing biodiversity. Third, SPAs provide novel opportunities for research and public exposure to native biodiversity. We also describe how cultivation can alter plant fitness compared to wildland plants, which acts as a multiplier to their conservation implications. SPAs could lead to two interrelated negative consequences that generate risks for taxonomic and genetic diversity at multiple scales: (1) SPAs can cause and multiply negative genetic legacies as a result of cultivation practices, and (2) SPA progenies can numerically and genetically dominate wildland plant populations. Nevertheless, SPA cultivation offers an opportunity to genetically diversify SPA-derived populations for success in restoration and enlarge the pool of species available for restoration, thus mitigating or solving some of these risks. Targeted government policies toward SPAs, additional research, and sound SPA management are necessary to minimize genetic risks and taxonomic redundancy, and also to maximize the conservation benefits of SPAs.","[Zinnen, Jack; Matthews, Jeffrey W.] Univ Illinois, Dept Nat Resources & Environm Sci, 1102 S Goodwin Ave, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Broadhurst, Linda M.] CSIRO, Natl Res Collect Australia, Ctr Australian Natl Biodivers Res, GPO Box 1700, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia; [Gibson-Roy, Paul] Kalbar Operat, Bailey St, Bairnsdale, Vic 3875, Australia; [Jones, Thomas A.] USDA ARS, Forage & Range Res Lab, 696 N 1100 E, Logan, UT 84322 USA",jzinnen2@illinois.edu,111,6,6,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0960-3115,BIODIVERS CONSERV,Biodivers.

International conservation arenas have developed criteria for effective MPA networks, with the IUCN-WCPA [1] outlining five ecological guidelines in designing resilient MPA networks. This review examines recent literature to: (1) assess the degree to which the five IUCN guidelines address large migratory at-risk pelagic species; (2) assess differences between the scientific literature and IUCN guidelines in the manner in which effective MPA networks are conceptualized for these species; (3) identify additional relevant design themes for effective conservation of migratory pelagics through MPA networks not addressed by the IUCN guidelines; and, (4) identify challenges and opportunities for the design of MPA networks for this suite of species. Results indicate that neither the literature nor the IUCN-WCPA guidelines provide comprehensive strategies for designing MPA networks for large, migratory pelagic species. The study concludes that the IUCN-WCPA guidelines can be potentially effective for these species if migratory connectivity is fully accounted for and complementary adaptive and dynamic mechanisms are developed for integration across wider seascapes and sectors at large regional and global scales. To this end, updates to the design guidelines for MPA networks are warranted, particularly with respect to connectivity, adaptive and dynamic approaches, and international collaborations.

The aim of this paper was to propose priority areas for conservation based on ecological niche and species distribution modeling of 22 species with the greatest ecological importance at the climax stage. Geographic records were correlated with bioclimatic temperature and precipitation variables using Maxent and Kuenm software for each species. The best Maxent models were chosen based on statistical significance, complexity and predictive power, and current potential distributions were obtained from these models. Future potential distributions were projected with two climate change scenarios: HADGEM2_ES and GFDL_CM3 models and RCP 8.5 W/m(2) by 2075-2099. All potential distributions for each scenario were then assembled for further analysis. We found that 14 tropical rainforest species have the potential for distribution in 97.4% of the landscape currently occupied by climax vegetation (0.6% of the country). Both climate change scenarios showed a 3.5% reduction in their potential distribution and possible displacement to higher elevation regions. Areas are proposed for tropical rainforest conservation where suitable bioclimatic conditions are expected to prevail.","[Fidel Santos-Hernandez, Antonio; Granados-Sanchez, Diodoro; Villanueva-Morales, Antonio] Univ Autonoma Chapingo, Div Ciencias Forestales, Km 38-5 Carretera Mexico Texcoco, Chapingo 56230, Estado De Mexic, Mexico; [Ismael Monterroso-Rivas, Alejandro] Univ Autonoma Chapingo, Dept Suelos, Km 38-5 Carretera Mexico Texcoco, Chapingo 56230, Estado De Mexic, Mexico; [Santacruz-Carrillo, Malinali] Comis Nacl Forestal, Coordinac Gen Conservac & Restaurac, Gerencia Sanidad Forestal, Perifer Poniente 5360, Zapopan 45019, Jalisco, Mexico",al18130102@chapingo.mx; aimrivas@correo.chapingo.mx; dgranadoss@chapingo.mx; avillanuevam@chapingo.mx; malisc27@gmail.com,72,4,4,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,FORESTS,Forests,2021,gold,

In the eastern Carpathian region, silvo-pastoralism was commonplace by the mid-1900s. This study aimed to determine the state of the preservation of the ecotonal character of grassland-woodland interfaces in formerly pastured cultural landscapes of SE-Polish Carpathian foothills and W-Ukrainian Ciscarpathia in the context of land-use change. In the first region, despite the long-lasting history of forest grazing amongst mainly arable land, the post-WWII collapse of husbandry and the imposed ban on forest grazing, has led to swift development of dense undergrowth and establishment of impermeable ecological woodland-open habitat barrier. As a result, former silvo-pastoral oakwoods developed the features of the Tilio-Carpinentum forest community although some forest species have not yet moved in due to their poor dispersibility. The much younger oakwoods in the Ukrainian study region are remnants of the sparsely treed grasslands, some of which had been ploughed in the mid 20th century. Their semi-open canopy structure, maintained through repetitive grass burning, contributes to the communities ecotonal character, but without regular livestock-led plant spill-over from the grassland, the oakwoods remain species-poor. The restoration of species-rich semi-open oak woods requires unsealing the forest-grassland interface, reducing the degree of canopy closure, and opening that zone up to extensive grazing-an important seed dispersal vector.","[Wolanski, Pawel] Univ Rzeszow, Inst Agr Sci Land Management & Environm Protect, Dept Agroecol, PL-35601 Rzeszow, Poland; [Bobiec, Andrzej; Ortyl, Bernadetta; Makuch-Pietras, Iwona] Univ Rzeszow, Inst Agr Sci Land Management & Environm Protect, Dept Nat Conservat & Landscape Ecol, PL-35601 Rzeszow, Poland; [Czarnota, Pawel] Univ Rzeszow, Inst Agr Sci Land Management & Environm Protect, Dept Ecol & Environm Protect, PL-35601 Rzeszow, Poland; [Ziobro, Jan] Univ Rzeszow, Rzeszow, Poland; [Korol, Mykola; Havryliuk, Serhii] Ukrainian Natl Forestry Univ, Forestry & Pk Gardening, UA-79057 Lvov, Ukraine; [Paderewski, Jakub] Warsaw Univ Life Sci, Dept Expt Design & Bioinformat, PL-02787 Warsaw, Poland; [Kirby, Keith] Univ Oxford, Dept Plant Sci, Oxford OX1 3RBL, England",wolanski@ur.edu.pl; a_bobiec@ur.edu.pl; zawadzka@ur.edu.pl; makuchiw@ur.edu.pl; pawczarnota@poczta.onet.pl; j.s.ziobro@gmail.com; nikkorol@ukr.net; serhiy_havrylyuk@nltu.edu.ua; jakub_paderewski@sggw.pl; keith.kirby@bnc.oxon.org,52,3,4,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0960-3115,BIODIVERS CONSERV,Biodivers.

Such a 'fortress conservation' approach is based on the flawed idea that local people's use of forests endangers biodiversity and therefore habitats should be protected by force if necessary. Such a conservation approach runs contrary to the recent understanding that ecosystems once perceived as 'wilderness' have been transformed by people. Long-term interdisciplinary research has produced a nuanced understanding of the linkages between ecological and social processes. An example of such long-term engagement is a series of programmes by Ashoka Trust for Research in Ecology and the Environment (ATREE) in the Western Ghats and the Himalayas. We describe programmes in four sites: Kalakad Mundanthurai Tiger reserve, Biligiri Rangaswamy Temple Tiger Reserve, Senchal Wildlife Sanctuary and Vembanad Ramsar site. Our experiences highlight primarily, a broadening of the initial focus on the ecological dynamics to include social dimensions. Secondly, a programmatic rather than a project-mode approach has enabled a clear long-term vision. Third, the research and action work has continued a tradition in conservation science of field-based, empirical work driven by theory as well as produced grounded knowledge. Such a long-term 'dirt on the boots' approach has built a platform from which ATREE is able to launch programmes that have made an impact on livelihoods and landscapes.

In this context, modeling the effect of strategic threats on decision-making is a challenging problem that has not been sufficiently addressed. Using a security game approach, this paper investigates the optimal conservation of a food web against a strategic threat. The model builds upon the non-cooperative Stackelberg game, wherein conservator (defender) and adversary (attacker) play as leader and follower, respectively. The objective of the defender is to preventively maximize the entire web reliability, under financial and ecological constraints. The defender optimally manipulates the populations of an optimal subset of species to achieve this. In contrast, the attacker attempts to maximize web unreliability by decreasing the population of selected species, using limited resources. A metaheuristic algorithm is developed to compute the equilibrium strategy, and the model is validated through numerical examples. Additionally, in a scenario-based approach, it is examined how the defense and attack strategies, as well as food web reliability, change as the population of keystone species change. The results also show that the combinational use of mathematical optimization and food web-specific conservation prioritization indices yields a practical tool for food web conservation prioritization. The results specifically yield theoretical insights into how to optimally control trophic cascade effects due to changing keystone species populations.

Incomplete and inconsistent ecological information can limit the contribution of mitigation plans for incidental take, especially those for multiple species, to species persistence. Many such plans focus on acquisition and management of coarse-resolution land-cover or land-use types. These classifications may not coincide with a species' resource requirements (its habitat) or the greatest constraints to its viability. Complementing acquisition with rigorous research on population biology, stressors, and habitat use and quality may be much more effective than preservation of putative but unproven habitat. Such adaptive conservation can be applied to species with restricted or extensive distributions. When the distribution and ecology of geographically restricted species are well-known, then connectivity analyses, sometimes complemented by spatially explicit, mechanistic population models, may inform habitat acquisition and management. When little information exists on the ecology or vital rates of a restricted species, we suggest assessment of occupancy, habitat use, or demography; tracking individuals' movements; and evaluation of habitat quality. Acquisition and management of local lands that may not serve as habitat is unlikely to contribute to conservation of extensively distributed species with range-wide declines. Instead, we suggest that conservation efforts for these species emphasize strategic acquisition of open space (large, undeveloped areas that are more likely to serve as high-quality habitat), potentially in locations distant from the permit area. The above areas of research can inform optimization of conservation locations. Many mitigation decisions are based on assumptions drawn from limited data. Inclusion of scientific research in development and implementation of mitigation plans for incidental take can strengthen the plans' information content, improve the ecological success acquisition and management, and advance conservation of protected species.","[Fleishman, Erica] Oregon State Univ, Coll Earth Ocean & Atmospher Sci, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [George, T.

Shifting baseline syndrome (SBS) describes a persistent downgrading of perceived 'normal' environmental conditions with every sequential generation, leading to under-estimation of the true magnitude of long-term environmental change on a global scale. The presence of SBS should be considered when local ecological knowledge and participatory techniques are involved in conservation target-setting. However, despite increasing recognition of the phenomenon, there is little empirical evidence for SBS. Here we provide evidence of SBS, and the first empirical investigation of the impacts of SBS on public perceptions of conservation need. 2. Large-scale online questionnaires were used to collect public perceptions of long-term biological change regarding 10 UK bird species, as well as demographic information and measures of knowledge and experience of the local environment (n = 330). A paired data approach compared social perceptions to a large-scale longitudinal biological dataset. Using information theoretic and model selection techniques, we estimate the relative importance of multiple demographic, social and psychological predictors of SBS. We provide a framework for investigating evidence of SBS and its impacts on perceptions of conservation need for species in decline. 3. Evidence of generational amnesia was found as an age-related difference in perceptions of past ecological conditions. The perceptions of older participants had significantly higher agreement with biological data than the perceptions of younger participants. Our results therefore support the expectation that younger, less experienced people are less aware of historical ecological conditions and show greater evidence of SBS. We also present evidence of a negative impact of SBS on future conservation, as older people were more likely than younger people to perceive a greater need for conservation action for three declining species. 4. Our research supports the need to encourage greater intergenerational communication and increase experience of local nature. Discovering evidence of SBS in public perceptions of species experienced within everyday life demonstrates SBS as a pervasive social issue with the potential to impact public perceptions of local nature.","[Jones, Lizzie P.; Papworth, Sarah K.] Royal Holloway Univ London, Sch Biol Sci, Egham, Surrey, England; [Jones, Lizzie P.; Turvey, Samuel T.] Zool Soc London, Inst Zool, London, England; [Massimino, Dario] British Trust Ornithol, Thetford, England",lizzie.jones42@gmail.com; sarah.papworth@rhul.ac.uk,89,7,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",,PEOPLE NAT,People Nat.,2020,"Green Published, gold",

Taxus contorta, an endangered gymnosperm has reached a decisive state in the Western Himalayas, thus, demands immediate attention to rescue it. This study aims to elucidate population and landscape genetics of T. contorta to plan a successful conservation strategy. We used SSR genotyping to identify genetic diversity hotspots, and ecological niche modeling to reveal climatic hotspots of T. contorta in the Indian Western Himalayas. We observed a substantial genetic diversity, and a negligible level of inbreeding among T. contorta populations. A genetic bottleneck was observed in several populations. We propose that changing climate can cause a failure of an entire conservation management plan if the shift produces a degraded environment in the future, at the sites of conservation. Further, the conservation management is futile if it fails to enhance or conserve the genetic diversity. We propound that use of germplasm from genetic diversity hotspots for propagation in climatic hotspots, and prioritization of these hotspot patches for conservation would ensure greater genetic variability under a safe environment. This integrative approach of translating molecular and climatic data into conservation planning would save our efforts, time, and capital investment, and ensure greater success in managing the revival of T. contorta in the Western Himalayas.","[Majeed, Aasim; Singh, Amandeep; Bhardwaj, Pankaj] Cent Univ Punjab, Dept Bot, Mol Genet Lab, City Campus,Mansa Rd, Bathinda 151001, India",pankajihbt@gmail.com,69,1,1,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1566-0621,CONSERV GENET,Conserv.

Although many of the threats faced by vultures have been identified, the impact of human activities on the social life of vultures has received little attention. In this paper, we emphasize the need to integrate vulture sociality into conservation practice. First, we summarize current knowledge on vulture social behavior, and the evolutionary and ecological roots of their breeding systems. We describe the existence of contrasting gradients in social foraging strategies and hierarchical social structures among colonial and territorial breeders associated with species (and population) reliance on carrion differing in size and predictability. We also highlight the potential role of vulture gatherings in maintaining population-level social structures and for mate-finding given high mate-selectivity. Next, based on this social framework, we discuss the impact of human activities on social foraging, territory structures, resource partitioning processes, and mating dynamics. However, little is known about how disruptions of social habits may have contributed to vulture population declines and/or may impede their recovery. Lastly, we provide directions for future research on vulture socio-ecology that may improve current conservation efforts. We encourage researchers and wildlife managers to pay more attention to natural carrion diversity underlying vulture social system diversity, especially when implementing supplementary feeding programs, and to consider the complex mating and settlement dynamics in reintroduction programs. Overall, we stress that understanding the complex social life of vultures is critical to harmonize their conservation with anthropogenic activities.","[van Overveld, Thijs; de la Riva, Manuel; Antonio Donazar, Jose] Estn Biol Donana CSIC, Dept Conservat Biol, Seville, Spain; [Blanco, Guillermo] Museo Nacl Ciencias Nat CSIC, Dept Evolutionary Ecol, Madrid, Spain; [Moleon, Marcos] Univ Granada, Dept Zool, Granada, Spain; [Margalida, Antoni] IREC CSIC UCLM JCCM, Inst Game & Wildlife Res, Ciudad Real, Spain; [Margalida, Antoni] Univ Bern, Inst Ecol & Evolut, Div Conservat Biol, Bern, Switzerland; [Antonio Sanchez-Zapata, Jose] Univ Miguel Hernandez, Dept Appl Biol, Elche, Spain",mathijs.van.overveld@gmail.com,240,8,8,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",,CONDOR,Condor,2020,,

The results show that 62% of the respondents perceived that mammal abundances had decreased, 31% perceived stability, and 8% perceived that mammals had increased between 2006 and 2017. The respondents attributed the decline to habitat degradation and illegal hunting. The knowledge of local people about mammal population trends is consistent with reported mammal encounters by law enforcement rangers. However, the length of residence, location of communities, and cardinal direction of communities influenced local peoples' knowledge of mammal abundance and population trends.

However, the mechanisms through which the establishment of PAs achieved significant positive effects remain unclear, and how different conservation mechanisms have achieved significant positive social and ecological benefits has also not been sufficiently studied. In this study, we systematically reviewed exemplary cases from Asia, Africa, and South America, using panel data to assess the conservation effectiveness of nature reserves and national parks. By surveying 629 literature samples reported in 31 studies, we found that the establishment of PAs has positive influences on poverty reduction, family incomes, household expenditure, employment, forest cover, biodiversity, carbon sequestration, and a reduction in forest fragmentation. Furthermore, we analyzed the specific aspects that influence the publication of a paper in a high-impact journal. We found that publication is more likely when the research uses panel data, matching methods of data analysis, large samples, and plots or PAs as research units and has significant evaluation results. Our results suggest that future studies should use panel data and matching method analysis to assess the impacts of PAs from multiple perspectives and focus on the effectiveness of specific conservation mechanisms in achieving positive effects.","[Ma, Ben] Renmin Univ China, Sch Environm & Nat Resources, Beijing 100872, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Yuqian] Michigan State Univ, Ctr Syst Integrat & Sustainabil, E Lansing, MI 48823 USA; [Hou, Yilei; Wen, Yali] Beijing Forestry Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China",maben20@ruc.edu.cn; zhan1364@msu.edu; houyilei427@163.com; wenyali@bjfu.edu.cn,48,4,4,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,INT J ENV RES PUB HE,Int.

We expand on the standard overview of the field by identifying some of the challenges associated with managing complex systems with multiple resources, multiple stakeholder groups with diverse knowledges/understandings, and multiple objectives across multiple scales, i.e., multifaceted collaborative initiatives. We then elucidate how a realist methodology, within a critical realist framing, can support efforts to compare multiple case studies of such multifaceted initiatives.

Typical studies of FFO behavior use self-reported survey data. FFOs across the United States collectively own more forested land than any other ownership category, and their actions will impact the public goods these forests provide. Thus, better measures of FFO actions are critical to understanding how these public goods may be affected. Background and Objectives: In this pilot study, we evaluated the potential of ecological momentary assessments to understand family forest owner (FFO) engagement with their woods. We sought to test recruitment, attrition, and participant reaction to the method. Materials and Methods: FFOs belong to woodland owner associations were sent the same questions weekly for a month, asking about woodland engagement. Results: Nearly 90% of participants completed all four surveys and the majority found the method reasonable. Most participants thought about their woods weekly, but a longer time period is needed to measure temporal management trends. Conclusions: This approach may yield real-time and useful information about natural resource engagement to inform conservation-based programming and outreach.","[Huff, Emily S.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Forestry, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Kittredge, David B.] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Environm Conservat, Amherst, MA 01003 USA",ehuff@msu.edu; dbkitt@gmail.com,25,0,0,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,FORESTS,Forests,2020,gold,

We located a total of 151 Gharial nests over 17 yr in sand banks along the Narayani = 94 nests) and Rapti (n = 57 nests) rivers and brought these nests to ex situ breeding facilities where eggs were artificially incubated. The number of nests (mean, 8.9/yr) showed an increasing trend over the years between 2001 and 2017. Nesting occurred within a narrow window of time (mean oviposition date, March 31) with onset of nesting varying by a maximum of 7 d between years (22-29 March). Similarly, eggs hatched from the first week of June through the first week of July (mean, June 15) after a mean incubation period of 76 d, with varying hatching success (mean, 60.5%). We did not find any correlation between incubation period and hatching success. Mean oviposition and hatching date both differed significantly among years probably due to annual variation in nesting cues. We found a significant positive correlation between clutch size and proportion of infertile eggs. Mean clutch size (32.3) and proportion of infertile eggs (mean, 10 eggs) both were significantly higher in clutches in Narayani than in Rapti; however, hatching success was significantly higher in clutches in Rapti. On average, nests had a circumference of 102.3 cm and a depth of 48.5 cm. Mean midriver depth (2.21 m) did not vary over the years but was higher in Narayani than in Rapti; however, mean depth of water nearest to the nest (1.15 m) varied among years and was higher in Rapti. Nests in Narayani were farther from the water's edge than nests in Rapti, suggesting local adaption of female Gharials to prevent flooding of nests owing to severe flooding in the Narayani. This is the first study to present long-term scientific information on nesting and reproduction of Gharials in Nepal. Such information will be pivotal in designing and implementing conservation programs as well as optimizing ex situ breeding practices for Gharials in Nepal.","[Khadka, Bed] Chitwan Natl Pk, Gharial Conservat Breeding Ctr, Chitwan, Nepal; [Bashyal, Ashish] Biodivers Conservancy Nepal, Rupandehi 32903, Nepal; [Luitel, Kishor P.] Middle Tennessee State Univ, Sch Agr, Murfreesboro, TN 37132 USA; [Kandel, Ram C.] Dept Natl Pk & Wildlife Conservat, Kathmandu, Nepal",a.bashyal@bioconnepal.org,29,1,1,HERPETOLOGISTS LEAGUE,LAWRENCE,"C/O ALLEN PRESS, PO BOX 7065, LAWRENCE, KS 66044 USA",0018-0831,HERPETOLOGICA,Herpetologica,2020,,

The aim is also to compare forest owners' values, attitudes, endorsement of an ecological worldview and objectives for forest ownership as well as the background characteristics in these groups. The data were collected in 2015, by a nationwide mail survey sent to 3000 Finnish family forest owners (n = 1035). Five forest owner types were identified:Conservationists, Moderate conservationists, Compensation oriented, Promoters of biodiversity through forest managementandUninterested. Previous experience of implementation of voluntary measures to safeguard biodiversity and positive attitudes towards conservation were important in explaining the willingness to adopt conservation measures. The results can be utilized in developing voluntary conservation programs and in targeting advisory services related to biodiversity protection to different forest owner groups more accurately.

Despite recent conceptual advances and potential management implications of the ecology of fear, theory and conservation practices have rarely been linked. Many challenges in animal conservation may be alleviated by actively harnessing or compensating for risk perception and risk avoidance behavior in wild animal populations. Integration of the ecology of fear into conservation and management practice can contribute to the recovery of threatened populations, human-wildlife conflict mitigation, invasive species management, maintenance of sustainable harvest and species reintroduction plans. Here, we present an applied framework that links conservation interventions to desired outcomes by manipulating ecology of fear dynamics. We discuss how to reduce or amplify fear in wild animals by manipulating habitat structure, sensory stimuli, animal experience (previous exposure to risk) and food safety trade-offs to achieve management objectives. Changing the optimal decision-making of individuals in managed populations can then further conservation goals by shaping the spatiotemporal distribution of animals, changing predation rates and altering risk effects that scale up to demographic consequences. We also outline future directions for applied research on fear ecology that will better inform conservation practices. Our framework can help scientists and practitioners anticipate and mitigate unintended consequences of management decisions, and highlight new levers for multi-species conservation strategies that promote human-wildlife coexistence.","[Gaynor, Kaitlyn M.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Natl Ctr Ecol Anal & Synth, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Gaynor, Kaitlyn M.; Smith, Justine A.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Environm Sci Policy & Management, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Cherry, Michael J.] Texas A&M Univ, Caesar Kleberg Wildlife Res Inst, Kingsville, TX USA; [Gilbert, Sophie L.] Univ Idaho, Dept Fish & Wildlife Sci, Moscow, ID 83843 USA; [Kohl, Michel T.] Univ Georgia, Warnell Sch Forestry & Nat Resources, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Larson, Courtney L.] Nature Conservancy, Lander, WY USA; [Newsome, Thomas M.] Univ Sydney, Sch Life & Environm Sci, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Prugh, Laura R.] Univ Washington, Sch Environm & Forest Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Suraci, Justin P.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Environm Studies, Ctr Integrated Spatial Res, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Young, Julie K.] USDA, Predator Res Facil, Natl Wildlife Res Ctr, Millville, UT USA; [Smith, Justine A.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Wildlife Fish & Conservat Biol, Davis, CA 95616 USA",gaynor@nceas.ucsb.edu,148,7,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1367-9430,ANIM CONSERV,Anim.

Habitat loss and fragmentation, invasive species, and human persecution have led to population declines, and therefore produced a need for an up-to-date assessment of the conservation status of the species. Although the true conservation status of Chilabothrus subflavus is unknown, it is currently listed as a Protected Animal under the Wild Life Protection Act of Jamaica, as Vulnerable by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature, and as an Endangered Foreign Species by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Habitat loss and fragmentation, coupled with introduced invasive species and human persecution, make it difficult to implement in situ management strategies to conserve the largest native snake species of Jamaica. Much of the information concerning Chilabothrus subflavus is challenging to obtain because it occurs within government documents and reports; therefore, no synthesis on the current state of knowledge of this species exists. Herein, we summarize the available published information on the biology, natural history, and ecology of Chilabothrus subflavus as well as review all data from captive breeding programs as it relates to the preservation and maintenance of genetic diversity in wild populations.

Reservoirs and associated river fragments are novel ecosystems not experienced by fishes in their evolutionary history, yet they are now commonplace across the globe. Understanding how fishes use these novel habitats is vital to conservation efforts in contemporary riverscapes. 2. Movement patterns of the endangered razorback sucker (Xyrauchen texanus) synthesized from tagging efforts in the upper Colorado River basin, USA, illustrate the applications of tagging technology and data sharing by multiple agencies to better understand the spatial ecology of large river fishes. 3. Tagging studies between 2014 and 2018 in Lake Powell and its two main tributary rivers, the Colorado (unfragmented) and San Juan (waterfall-fragmented), were used to quantify movement of razorback sucker within this river-reservoir habitat complex. In addition, facilitated translocations of fish upstream of a waterfall barrier in the San Juan River were assessed in 2016-2017. 4. Extensive movement of fish occurred within and across river and reservoir habitats. Of 722 fish captured in the Colorado River arm of Lake Powell, 36% of re-encounters occurred upstream in the Colorado or Green rivers, or fish dispersed through the reservoir and were detected in the San Juan River arm. Fourteen fish moved more than 600 km. In the San Juan arm of the reservoir, 29% and 20% of fish in 2017 and 2018, respectively, had moved similar to 30-40 km upstream below the waterfall in the San Juan River within a year. In 2016-2017, 303 fish were translocated upstream of the waterfall into the San Juan River, but 80% were re-encountered downstream of the waterfall within a year. 5. Long-distance movements by razorback sucker were common within and among rivers and reservoirs illustrating how large river fish, in general, might maintain population connectivity in highly altered ecosystems.","[Pennock, Casey A.; Gido, Keith B.; Hedden, Skyler C.] Kansas State Univ, Div Biol, Ackert Hall, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA; [McKinstry, Mark C.; Speas, David W.] US Bur Reclamat, Upper Colorado Reg Off, Salt Lake City, UT USA; [Cathcart, Charles N.] Alaska Dept Fish & Game, Alaska Freshwater Fish Inventory, 333 Raspberry Rd, Anchorage, AK 99518 USA; [Francis, Travis A.; Elverud, Darek S.; Schleicher, Benjamin J.] US Fish & Wildlife Serv, Grand Junct Fish & Wildlife Conservat Off, Grand Junction, CO USA; [Hines, Brian A.; Creighton, Katherine] Utah Div Wildlife Resources, Moab Field Stn, Moab, UT USA; [MacKinnon, Peter D.] Utah State Univ, Dept Watershed Sci, Logan, UT 84322 USA; [Gilbert, Eliza, I] US Fish & Wildlife Serv, New Mexico Ecol Serv Field Off, Albuquerque, NM USA; [Cheek, Christopher A.] Purdue Univ, Dept Forestry & Nat Resources, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA",casey.pennock@usu.edu,81,4,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1052-7613,AQUAT CONSERV,Aquat.

Key informant interviews with sacred forest custodians (n = 6), household administered questionnaire surveys (n = 160) in three villages surrounding the sacred forest and field observations were employed to collect data. Data obtained from interviews were analysed using thematic content analysis, while the questionnaires were assessed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS). Field observations helped to corroborate the results from the interviews and questionnaires. The study found that the key TEK that is used to conserve sacred forest in the study area includes rituals (u phasa) and customs for the protection of ancient burial grounds. Other important TEK comprises myths (lightning bird-Ndadzi and ancestral lion) and taboos involving a complete ban on activities in the forest other than the above-mentioned rituals. The study also found that the local communities have positive attitudes towards conservation of the local sacred forest. The positive attitudes equated to compliance as local communities were found not to harvest fuelwood or hunt in the sacred forest because of respect for, and fear of, different forms of TEK. These findings confirmed that TEK contributes to the conservation and protection of sacred forest in the study area. (C) 2020 The Authors.

Those trends qualitatively summarise the increase or decrease in the variable of interest over a given time period. Yet, linear trends do not capture changes in the direction or in the rate of change of indices such as population trajectories, that may typically occur when conditions improve or worsen following conservation actions or environmental disturbances. In a similar way, non-linear methods while aiming to fully characterise population trajectories, fail to end up with a standard classification. Here, we propose and test a simple method to classify the trajectory of a given ecological variable according to its trend and acceleration. Our method is based on fitting a second order polynomial that is used to describe a trajectory according to its direction, velocity, and curvature (accelerated or decelerated). We apply this method to the temporal dynamics of bird populations monitored by the French Breeding Bird Survey as a case study. Using data for more than 100 species monitored from 1989 to 2017 in more than 2000 sites, we show that one quarter of the studied species have dynamics that can be better described by our polynomial approach than typically-used linear analysis.

Without efficient methods, surveying is difficult or even impossible. Consequently, some of the most threatened species and regions remain un- or under-surveyed, e.g. South American Chaco. Survey methods based on local ecological knowledge (LEK-methods) could be useful for surveying these areas and species. However, LEK-methods may be inaccurate and are rarely evaluated or compared to standard-methods. This is the first large-scale study evaluating the performance of two LEK-methods, and comparing it with the performance of standard-methods, for detecting three species of large terrestrial mammals. We used a locally-based survey (LBS) and interviews as LEK-methods, and transect and camera trapping as standard survey methods. We estimated the probability of detecting each species with each method, of having false-presences and their cost. We also quantitatively analysed the ability of LBS to build local capacity, focusing on conservation, research and working skills. We found that compared to standard-methods, LEK-methods increase detection probabilities of three species while providing accurate information. LBSs are more expensive than interviews but improve local capacities, raising the chances of successful implementation of community-based conservation programmes. Interviews are optimal for rapid assessments and can be useful for wildlife monitoring. Before using LEK-methods, we recommend pilot studies to determine estimators' variability. Overall, this study shows that LEK-based methods can be efficient and accurate for detecting large mammals in remote areas. Furthermore, LEK-methods can help develop legitimate conservation initiatives.","[Camino, Micaela; Andrade, Laura; Cortez, Sara; Altrichter, Mariana] Proyecto Quimilero, Roosevelt 4344, RA-1430 Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Camino, Micaela] Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, Ctr Ecol Aplicada Litoral, Lab Biol Conservac, CECOAL, Natl Rd 5 Km 2-5, RA-3400 Corrientes Capital City, Corrientes, Argentina; [Camino, Micaela] Zool Soc London EDGE ZSL, Edge Existence Programme, Regents Pk, London NW1 4RY, England; [Thompson, Jeffrey] Natl Sci & Technol Council Paraguay CONACYT, Dr Justo Prieto 223, Asuncion 1416, Paraguay; [Thompson, Jeffrey] Guyra Paraguay, Asuncion, Paraguay; [Matteucci, Silvia D.] Grp Ecol Paisaje & Medio Ambiente GEPAMA, Pab 3 Ciudad Univ, RA-1428 Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Matteucci, Silvia D.] Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, Godoy Cruz 2290,C1425FQB, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Altrichter, Mariana] Prescott Coll, 220 Grove Ave, Prescott, AZ 86301 USA; [Altrichter, Mariana] IUCN SSC Peccary Specialist Grp, Gland, Switzerland",micaela_camino@hotmail.com; spcortez@gmail.com; sdmatteucci@conicet.gov.ar; marianaalt@msn.com,56,19,19,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0006-3207,BIOL CONSERV,Biol.

One prevailing solution is to generate cost-minimizing marine conservation strategies using static spatial prioritization tools. However, there is a need to understand the social-ecological impacts of considering dynamics. We applied a grid-based dynamic model with biological and fleet sub-models, and examined the social-ecological effects of three cost-minimizing conservation strategies over a 20-year planning horizon (medium term), incorporating dynamics in fish populations and fisher behaviors, and associated uncertainties. This study shows a trade-off among cost minimization conservation strategies between conservation and socio-economic benefits. Estimated opportunity costs were different between static and dynamic methods, highlighting the necessity to include dynamic costs as an extra source in decision-making. We caution that relying solely on opportunity costs as the criterion to guide conservation practices can be misleading as it may fail to reflect overarching social-ecological objectives. The study contributes to a further understanding of prevailing strategies' potentials and limitations, and equips practitioners with a dynamic perspective to choose the best conservation strategy.","[Li, Yunzhou; Sun, Ming; Ren, Yiping] Ocean Univ China, Coll Fisheries, Qingdao 266003, Peoples R China; [Li, Yunzhou; Sun, Ming; Evans, Keith S.; Chen, Yong] Univ Maine, Sch Marine Sci, Orono, ME 04469 USA; [Evans, Keith S.] Univ Maine, Sch Econ, Orono, ME 04469 USA; [Ren, Yiping] Pilot Natl Lab Marine Sci & Technol Qingdao, Lab Marine Fisheries Sci & Food Prod Proc, Qingdao 266237, Peoples R China",renyip@ouc.edu.cn,42,3,3,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0006-3207,BIOL CONSERV,Biol.

If so, knowledge of historical landscapes and their socio-ecological transitions would be useful for sustainable land use planning. We constructed a GIS dataset in 10 x 10 km UTM cells of the province of Barcelona (Catalonia, Spain) for 1956 and 2009 with the changing levels of farming disturbance exerted through the human appropriation of photosynthetic net primary production (HANPP), and a set of landscape ecology metrics to assess the impacts of the corresponding land-use changes. Then, we correlated them with the spatial distribution of total species richness (including vascular plants, amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals). The results allow us to characterize the main trends in changing landscape patterns and processes, and explore whether a land-use legacy of many complex agroforest mosaics maintained by the intermediate farming disturbance managed in 1956 could still exist, despite the decrease or disappearance of those mosaics before 2009 due to the combined impacts of agroindustrial intensification (meaning higher HANPP levels), forest transition (meaning lower HANPP levels) and urban sprawl. Statistical analysis reveals a positive impact of the number of larger, less disturbed forest patches, where many protected natural sites have been created in 1956-2009. However, it also confirms that this result has not only been driven by conservation policies and that the distribution of species richness is currently correlated with the maintenance of intermediate levels of HANPP. This suggests that both land-sharing and land-sparing approaches to biodiversity conservation may have played a synergistic role owing to the legacy of complex land cover mosaics of former agricultural landscapes that are now under a serious threat.","[Tello, Enric] Univ Barcelona, Inst Policy & World Econ, Dept Econ Hist, Fac Econ & Business, Av Diagonal 690, Barcelona 08034, Spain; [Marull, Joan; Padro, Roc; Coll, Francesc] Autonomous Univ Barcelona, Barcelona Inst Reg & Metropolitan Studies, Edifici MRA,Planta 2, Bellaterra 08193, Spain; [Cattaneo, Claudio] Masaryk Univ, Dept Environm Studies, Fac Social Studies, Jostova 10, Brno 60200, Czech Republic",tello@ub.edu; Joan.Marull@uab.cat; Roc.Padro@uab.cat; claudio.cattaneo@uab.cat; francesc.coll@uab.cat,67,3,3,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,2020,"gold, Green Published",

Conservation of urban wildlife has prioritised parks and remnant bushland as critical habitat and neglected the role that residential gardens offer for conservation. We explored the potential for residential gardens to assist the conservation of mammals using an online questionnaire administered to residents of two case study cities in Australia to identify how widespread mammals in cities can be, which garden features promote mammal presence, and if the features varied among species with different habitat requirements. From 649 responses we found that three mammal species with different habitat requirements occurred in residential gardens throughout the city landscape. Garden features promoting mammal presence were consistent with broad ecological and habitat requirements of each species, but differed among both species and regions. Our study demonstrates that residential gardens offer a valuable habitat for mammals, and that garden features could be manipulated to promote use of gardens by these species. By considering gardens in urban planning and management actions aimed at conserving urban wildlife, residential gardens offer additional habitat to parks, roadside vegetation and urban bushland, and can play a significant role in biodiversity conservation.","[Van Helden, Bronte E.; Close, Paul G.] Univ Western Australia, UWA Sch Agr & Environm, Fac Sci, Albany, WA, Australia; [Steven, Rochelle] Univ Queensland, Sch Biol Sci, St Lucia, Qld, Australia; [Steven, Rochelle] Univ Queensland, Threatened Species Recovery Hub, St Lucia, Qld, Australia",bronte.vanhelden@research.uwa.edu.au; paul.close@uwa.edu.au; r.steven@uq.edu.au,69,12,12,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1083-8155,URBAN ECOSYST,Urban Ecosyst.,2020,,

As a means of compensation, constructed wetlands (CWs), which are built to treat agricultural runoff and municipal wastewater, have become important for maintaining biodiversity. Here, we review studies on the relationships between CWs and their associated biodiversity published over the past three decades. In doing so, we provide an overview of how wildlife utilizes CWs, and the effects of biodiversity on pollutant transformation and removal. Beyond their primary aim (to purify various kinds of wastewater), CWs provide sub-optimal habitat for many species and, in turn, their purification function can be strongly influenced by the biodiversity that they support. However, there are some difficulties when using CWs to conserve biodiversity because some key characteristics of these engineered ecosystems vary from natural wetlands, including some fundamental ecological processes. Without proper management intervention, these features of CWs can promote biological invasion, as well as form an 'ecological trap' for native species. Management options, such as basin-wide integrative management and building in more natural wetland components, can partially offset these adverse impacts. Overall, the awareness of managers and the public regarding the potential value of CWs in biodiversity conservation remains superficial. More in-depth research, especially on how to balance different stakeholder values between wastewater managers and conservationists, is now required.","[Zhang, Chengxiang; Wang, Yuyu; Lei, Guangchun] Beijing Forestry Univ, Sch Nat Conservat, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China; [Wen, Li] Dept Planning Ind & Environm, Sci Div, Lidcombe 2141, Australia; [Liu, Cunqi] Hebei Univ, Coll Life Sci, Baoding 071002, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Yan] Nanjing Forestry Univ, Coll Biol & Environm, Coinnovat Ctr Sustainable Forestry Southern China, Nanjing 210037, Peoples R China",chengxiang116@163.com; li.wen@environment.nsw.gov.au; wangyy@bjfu.edu.cn; lcq@hbu.edu.cn; yzy01986@163.com; guangchun.lei@foxmail.com,154,11,12,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,2020,gold,

The hypothesis is that traditional beiradeiros activities are congruent with the aims of conservation of the reserve because their impacts are either neutral or enhance diversity of forest landscapes and biota. We designed the methodology underlying data collection to integrate forest inventory with archaeological techniques in two contrasting forest types (terra firme and seasonally inundated forest), faunal surveys, freelisting of tree terms by beiradeiros, and participant observation, in order to determine biological diversity indices, forest age and the parameters of traditional knowledge that encode such diversity in local vocabulary.

The deep sea (>200 m depth) encompasses >95% of the world's ocean volume and represents the largest and least explored biome on Earth (<0.0001% of ocean surface), yet is increasingly under threat from multiple direct and indirect anthropogenic pressures. Our ability to preserve both benthic and pelagic deep-sea ecosystems depends upon effective ecosystem-based management strategies and monitoring based on widely agreed deep-sea ecological variables. Here, we identify a set of deep-sea essential ecological variables among five scientific areas of the deep ocean: (1) biodiversity; (2) ecosystem functions; (3) impacts and risk assessment; (4) climate change, adaptation and evolution; and (5) ecosystem conservation. Conducting an expert elicitation (1,155 deep-sea scientists consulted and 112 respondents), our analysis indicates a wide consensus amongst deep-sea experts that monitoring should prioritize large organisms (that is, macro- and megafauna) living in deep waters and in benthic habitats, whereas monitoring of ecosystem functioning should focus on trophic structure and biomass production. Habitat degradation and recovery rates are identified as crucial features for monitoring deep-sea ecosystem health, while global climate change will likely shift bathymetric distributions and cause local extinction in deep-sea species. Finally, deep-sea conservation efforts should focus primarily on vulnerable marine ecosystems and habitat-forming species. Deep-sea observation efforts that prioritize these variables will help to support the implementation of effective management strategies on a global scale.","[Danovaro, Roberto; Fanelli, Emanuela; Carugati, Laura; Dell'Anno, Antonio] Polytech Univ Marche, Dept Life & Environm Sci, Ancona, Italy; [Danovaro, Roberto] Stn Zool Anton Dohrn, Naples, Italy; [Aguzzi, Jacopo] CSIC, ICM, Barcelona, Spain; [Billett, David; Ruhl, Henry] Natl Oceanog Ctr, Southampton, Hants, England; [Corinaldesi, Cinzia] Polytech Univ Marche, Dept Sci & Engn Mat Environm & Urban Planning SIM, Ancona, Italy; [Gjerde, Kristina] IUCN Global Marine & Polar Programme, Gland, Switzerland; [Jamieson, Alan J.] Newcastle Univ, Sch Nat & Environm Sci, Newcastle Upon Tyne, Tyne & Wear, England; [Kark, Salit] Univ Queensland, Sch Biol Sci, Biodivers Res Grp, Ctr Biodivers & Conservat Sci, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [McClain, Craig] Louisiana Univ Marine Consortium, Chauvin, LA 70344 USA; [Levin, Lisa] Univ Calif, Ctr Marine Biodivers & Conservat, Scripps Inst Oceanog, La Jolla, CA USA; [Levin, Lisa] Univ Calif, Integrat Oceanog Div, Scripps Inst Oceanog, La Jolla, CA USA; [Levin, Noam] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Geog, Jerusalem, Israel; [Ramirez-Llodra, Eva] Norwegian Inst Water Res, Oslo, Norway; [Ruhl, Henry] Monterey Bay Aquarium Res Inst, Moss Landing, CA USA; [Smith, Craig R.] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Oceanog, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Snelgrove, Paul V.

In this Perspective, the authors explore the effects of time lags on biodiversity indicators using both theory and empirical data. Global conservation targets to reverse biodiversity declines and halt species extinctions are not being met despite decades of conservation action. However, a lack of measurable change in biodiversity indicators towards these targets is not necessarily a sign that conservation has failed; instead, temporal lags in species' responses to conservation action could be masking our ability to observe progress towards conservation success. Here we present our perspective on the influence of ecological time lags on the assessment of conservation success and review the principles of time lags and their ecological drivers. We illustrate how a number of conceptual species may respond to change in a theoretical landscape and evaluate how these responses might influence our interpretation of conservation success. We then investigate a time lag in a real biodiversity indicator using empirical data and explore alternative approaches to understand the mechanisms that drive time lags. Our proposal for setting and evaluating conservation targets is to use milestones, or interim targets linked to specific ecological mechanisms at key points in time, to assess whether conservation actions are likely to be working.

Testudines are distributed across diverse regions, including areas under severe anthropogenic pressure, and many species are threatened, mainly due to habitat loss and overexploitation. We reviewed scientific literature published between 1995 and 2016 to assess taxonomic and geographic patterns in home ranges of freshwater and terrestrial chelonians based on biological and ecological characteristics and conservation status. We examined the trait home range size, as well as its relationships with intrinsic and extrinsic factors (sex, diet, carapace size, habitat and study zone) and species-specific conservation status. Many of the reviewed studies focus on the Nearctic region, and Emydidae is the most commonly studied family. We found great variation in the home range sizes of species within the same family. Diet was identified as the main driver of home range size. Sex, carapace size, habitat and study zone were not significant as predictors of home range size. Conservation status does not seem to represent a factor driving the assessed studies since the number of investigations concerning threatened and non-threatened species was similar. Home range sizes of threatened species were significantly lower than those of non-threatened species.

However, how to accurately and reasonably determine the compensation standard for ecological services has not been guided by scientific methods and theories. This study provides an estimation of the compensation standard for forest ecological services based on the forest multifunction evaluation and financial net present value analysis, and a case study was performed in Southwest China. The results showed that most forest types brought some economic loss to the managers but contributed great ecological benefits to the public when they were managed as ecological forests.

The existence of golf courses in particular has been heavily debated due to widespread perceptions of these spaces as environmentally degrading. Though much of the total area of golf courses is occupied by heavily manicured lawns, Canadian golf courses tend to be well treed and thus show significant potential to enhance forest coverage and contribute to the conservation of native tree species when established on previously unforested land. To explore this potential, a tree inventory was carried out on an inner-city golf course in halifax, Nova Scotia, and findings compared to an earlier inventory of more naturalized (i.e., ingrowth) forest areas in the same city. Based in the Acadian Forest Region, this case study used the characteristics of a healthy and mature Acadian Forest as a model for ecological integrity. It was found that both the golf course and the ingrowth populations were largely representative of a mixedwood Acadian forest. Likewise, both populations were in a similar stage of regeneration and exhibited similar stresses. These results suggest that if improved forest management approaches are employed, golf courses will effectively strengthen the ecological integrity of urban forests. This is an especially important finding in the climate change era when tree populations are likely to be subjected to new environmental stressors which may be alleviated via the human intervention that is available on managed lands such as institutional greenspaces.","[Doll, Shauna; Duinker, Peter N.] Dalhousie Univ, Sch Resource & Environm Studies, Halifax, NS B3H 4R2, Canada",shauna.doll@dal.ca; peter.duinker@dal.ca,77,2,2,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,FORESTS,Forests,2020,gold,

Its existence is vital to the survival of many pollinator insects and endangered bird species and to the integrity of multiple islands' watersheds. Rapid 'Ohi'a Death (ROD) is an emerging fungal disease that poses a significant health risk for these trees and is spread by human traffic, ambrosia beetles, and wind dispersal. Loss of 'ohi'a forests will negatively affect Hawai'i's economy and ecology and will have detrimental impacts on Hawaiian culture, particularly because of the role of lehua flowers in hula. While transmission of ROD Death is not yet fully understood, human activity is currently considered the main proponent of its spread. Hawai'i's economy is largely built on the tourism industry; however, tourists are often unaware of the disease and the practices implemented to contain the current outbreak while visiting the Hawaiian Islands. ROD is a conservation issue that connects humans with the environment and must be addressed using a one-health perspective. This article aims to elucidate the anthropogenic factors contributing to the depletion of 'ohi'a lehua through the spread of ROD and to propose prevention measures that can be adopted by citizens and visitors. At the end of this case study, readers will understand the cultural, ecological, and economic significance of 'ohi'a lehua. Readers will also be able to identify important stakeholders and examine the complexity of behavior change in conservation issues.","[Martinez, Dayna; Duran, Elena M., I; Bauer, Natalie] Tufts Univ, Ctr Conservat Med, Cummings Sch Vet Med, Grafton, MA 01536 USA",nataliehbauer@gmail.com,39,0,0,UNIV CALIFORNIA PRESS,OAKLAND,"155 GRAND AVE, SUITE 400, OAKLAND, CA 94612-3758 USA",2473-9510,CASE STUD ENVIRON,Case Stud.

Here, we study ten taxa with known ethnopharmacological uses, which have been used extensively in traditional medicine and as culinary supplements. We aim to (1) predict and map the potential habitat suitability for these taxa across the study area, (2) investigate spatial patterns that could have management implications, such as niche similarities among the taxa and suitability hotspots with the use of novel indices, and (3) develop a platform where parts of this information can be accessed and utilized by all interested groups, from the policy-maker level to the individual practitioner level. Ecological Niche Models developed for each study taxon, based on topographic, bioclimatic, soil, and land use variables had high predictive power and were used as the basis for suitability visualization. A series of informative indices were also calculated and mapped, revealing spatial patterns not readily observable from the single-taxon predictions, and providing valuable information to managers. Finally, a web-based, easy-to-use application was also created, where the predicted suitability scores for the study area can be made accessible to anyone interested. The application can provide information both in a visual form (i.e. maps of predicted suitability) and in a numerical form(i.e. estimated suitability scores for all taxa in a given geographical location). This study provides the scientific tools to make a step towards cultivating a group of economically importantwild medicinal plants in Crete, as well as the tools to disseminate this information to decision makers and practitioners, and eventually integrate the research findings in local agricultural practices.

Added to the lack of a protocol to monitor this secretive bird, ever-growing threats make it necessary to study its global situation in depth to take accurate and urgent management decisions. We firstly studied how threats to the Austral Rail currently impact their occupancy and relative density (RD) at a wetland scale and habitat features associated with its presence at survey site scale inside wetlands in Santa Cruz province, Argentina. We additionally developed a monitoring protocol to detect the rail effectively and promptly by studying responses to playback with two different vocalisations at different times of the day and season. Both threats evaluated were negatively related to occupancy and RD of the Austral Rail, especially mink presence appearing to have an additive effect. We propose American mink control as crucial for Austral Rail conservation, while it would also be necessary to conserve a portion of wetlands exempt from burning and cattle presence. At survey sites, its presence was positively related with c.1-1.5 m tall rushes, whilst rails avoided low- density rush areas that resulted after management of rushes with fire to create pasture. To detect rails, both vocalisations can be confidently used at any time of the day and season. The poor knowledge about species ecology, mismanagement of vegetation in wetlands, expansion of American mink in Patagonia, construction on two dams in the Santa Cruz river basin, added to the already modified humidity conditions due to global climate change, force us to suggest that the Austral Rail should be considered as globally 'Endangered' (EN), to ensure the consideration of the species in management decisions.","[de Miguel, Andres; Fasola, Laura; Roesler, Ignacio; Martin, Lucia; Cossa, Natalia; Giusti, Emilia] Aves Argentinas, Programa Patagonia, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [de Miguel, Andres; Fasola, Laura; Roesler, Ignacio; Martin, Lucia; Cossa, Natalia; Giusti, Emilia] Aves Argentinas, Proyecto Maca Tobiano, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [de Miguel, Andres; Fasola, Laura; Roesler, Ignacio; Martin, Lucia; Cossa, Natalia; Giusti, Emilia] Asociac Ambiente Sur, Rio Gallegos, Argentina; [Fasola, Laura] Adm Parques Nacl, Delegac Tecn Patagonia, Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [de Miguel, Andres; Roesler, Ignacio; Cossa, Natalia; Giusti, Emilia] Univ Buenos Aires, IEGEBA CONICET, Lab Ecol & Comportamiento Anim, Dept Ecol Genet & Evolut,FCEN, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina",andi.demiguel@gmail.com,38,0,0,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0959-2709,BIRD CONSERV INT,Bird Conserv.

Drastic declines have been described in the UK, with the most severe declines occurring in rural areas. Hedgehogs are widely distributed in Denmark, but their status remains unknown. Fieldwork on hedgehogs has tended to focus on rural areas, leaving their ecology in suburban habitats largely unexplored, with clear implications for conservation initiatives. Here, we study the ecology of 35 juvenile hedgehogs using radio tracking during their first year of life in the suburbs of western Copenhagen. We use radio-tracking data to estimate (a) home range sizes in autumn and spring/summer, (b) survival during their first year of life, (c) the body mass changes before, during, and after hibernation, and (d) the hibernation behavior of the juvenile hedgehogs. We show that males and females have small home ranges compared with previous studies. The 95% MCP home range sizes in autumn were 1.33 ha (95% CI = 0.88-2.00) for males and 1.40 ha (95% CI = 0.84-2.32) for females; for spring/summer they were 6.54 ha (95% CI = 3.76-11.38) for males and 1.51 ha (95% CI = 0.63-3.63) for females. The juvenile survival probabilities during the study period from September 2014 to July 2015 were .56 for females and .79 for males. All healthy individuals gained body mass during the autumn and survived hibernation with little body mass loss thus demonstrating that the juveniles in the study were capable of gaining sufficient weight in the wild to survive their first hibernation. The climate is changing, but there is a lack of knowledge on how this affects mammal ecology. The exceptionally mild autumn of 2014 caused the juvenile hedgehogs to delay hibernation for up to a month compared with previous studies in Denmark.","[Rasmussen, Sophie L.; Berg, Thomas B.; Jones, Owen R.] Univ Southern Denmark, Dept Biol, Campusvej 55, DK-5230 Odense M, Denmark; [Rasmussen, Sophie L.; Dabelsteen, Torben] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Biol, Ecol & Evolut, Behav Ecol Grp, Copenhagen O, Denmark; [Berg, Thomas B.] Naturama, Svendborg, Denmark; [Jones, Owen R.] Univ Southern Denmark, Dept Biol, Interdisciplinary Ctr Populat Dynam CPop, Odense M, Denmark",sophielundrasmussen@gmail.com,0,20,20,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

The optimal complementary conservation areas are often identified by implementing two approaches in systematic conservation planning, i.e., unlocking or locking existing PAs. However, evidence-based studies are lacking for clarifying the efficiencies of these two planning approaches. With Sichuan in southwest China - part of a global biodiversity hotspot - as one case, this study first assessed the ecological representativeness of existing nature reserves (NRs). Using 32 natural vegetation types as the conservation features, we then implemented a systematic conservation planning process by running Marxan software with NR-unlocked and NR-locked scenarios. A human disturbance index was also included as a penalty function in Marxan for achieving cost-effective planning. We finally investigated the efficiencies of the unlocking and locking planning approaches by comparing the outcomes of the NR-unlocked and NR-locked scenarios. We found that existing NRs were geographically biased towards the western mountainous regions with high elevations and low human disturbance levels. For achieving the same quantitative conservation targets, the total area of the NR-locked priority conservation areas was 18.6% larger than that of the NR-unlocked areas, whereas the area of NR-locked complementary areas to existing NRs was 15.3% smaller than that of NR-unlocked ones. Moreover, the NR-locked priority conservation areas had higher ecological representativeness than NR-unlocked areas. The results suggest that if a completely new PA system is to be established without considering existing PAs, the unlocking approach could more efficiently achieve the full conservation targets at lower costs of land area and with better connected habitats. When existing PAs must be used as focal areas for expansion, the locking approach is more cost-effective for filling conservation gaps by requiring smaller amounts of complementary areas. Our analysis provides evidence-based support for expanding the current PA systems in a cost-effective manner. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

This approach differs from ecosystem restoration but the two concepts are often conflated because (a) they both rely on similar management actions (at least initially) and (b) it can be erroneously assumed that they both aim for similar states of wildness. Rewilding and restoring both influence biodiversity, and common management actions such as species reintroductions (e.g. beavers or wolves) can be integral to a rewilding project. However, in contrast with restoration, rewilding has lower fidelity to taxonomic precedent and promotes taxonomic substitutions for extinct native species that once underpinned the delivery of key ecological functions. We suggest the adaptive cycle as the appropriate conceptual framework in which to distinguish rewilding from ecosystem restoration. The focus of restoration ecology is to return an ecosystem to as close to its former state as is possible after a major disturbance, by directly reinstating it on the 'foreloop' of the adaptive cycle. In contrast, rewilding draws from the 'backloop' by promoting reorganization and redevelopment of the ecosystem under changing environmental conditions. If environmental conditions have changed so significantly that a regime shift is inevitable, then rewilding can facilitate the development of a novel ecosystem to sustain the provision of ecosystem services. Synthesis and applications. Rewilding and restoring both have their places in biodiversity conservation. In each case, their respective merits should be weighed in relation to stakeholder priorities, prevailing and predicted environmental conditions, the level of biological organization targeted for management, and existing and future management capacity. We provide simple schematic decision-pathways to assist in exploring whether an ecologically degraded landscape might be a candidate for restoration, active rewilding, or passive rewilding.","[du Toit, Johan T.] Utah State Univ, Dept Wildland Resources, Logan, UT 84322 USA; [Pettorelli, Nathalie] Zool Soc London, Inst Zool, London, England",johan.dutoit@usu.edu,25,14,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8901,J APPL ECOL,J.

Here, we quantitatively assess the scientific productivity of ESs and identify the main socio-ecological factors associated with different levels of scientific research. Specifically, we adopt a multi-model inference approach with a hurdle regression model to independently evaluate the factors associated with the presence/absence of research and the volume of studies in ESs. Surprisingly, given their stated remit, a large proportion of ESs had little or no scientific productivity. Results also indicate that older ESs were more likely to be associated with published research and that the volume of publications was associated with the number of years since the first article was published. The presence of a management plan and a management council were also significant positive drivers of research.

Nature-based solutions (NbS) that are inspired and supported by nature have the potential to deliver multifunctional environmental and social benefits to address these challenges in urban areas under context-specific conditions. NbS implementation often relies on a one-size-fits-all approach, although interventions that maximize one benefit (e.g., biodiversity conservation) may have no influence on, or even negatively affect, others (e.g., social justice). Furthermore, the current pathways from NbS to various benefits do not rely on a deep understanding of the underlying processes, prohibiting the identification of optimal solutions that maximize synergies across pathways. We present a comprehensive socio-ecological framework that addresses these issues by recognizing that cities are human-dominated environments that are foremost built and maintained to support humans. Our framework demonstrates how we can use experiments and niche species models to understand and predict where species will be and where people will be healthy and happy in a comparable manner. This knowledge can then be integrated into decision support tools that use optimization algorithms to understand trade-offs, identify synergies, and provide planners with the tools needed to tailor context-specific NbS to yield greener, more resilient cities with happier people and reduced inequality.","[Colleony, Agathe; Shwartz, Assaf] Technion Israel Inst Technol, Human & Biodivers Res Lab, Fac Architecture & Town Planning, IL-32000 Haifa, Israel",agathe.colleony@gmail.com,112,16,16,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,2019,gold,

Genetic approaches have largely contributed to conservation biology by defining conservation entities accounting for their evolutionary history and adaptive potential, the so-called evolutionary significant units (ESUs). Yet, these approaches only loosely integrate the short-term ecological history of organisms. Here, we argue that epigenetic variation, and more particularly DNA methylation, represents a molecular component of biodiversity that directly links the genome to the environment. As such, it provides the required information on the ecological background of organisms for an integrative field of conservation biology. We synthesize knowledge about the importance of epigenetic mechanisms in (a) orchestrating fundamental development alternatives in organisms, (b) enabling individuals to respond in real-time to selection pressures and (c) improving ecosystem stability and functioning. Using practical examples in conservation biology, we illustrate the relevance of DNA methylation (a) as biomarkers of past and present environmental stress events as well as biomarkers of physiological conditions of individuals; (b) for documenting the ecological structuring/clustering of wild populations and hence for better integrating ecology into ESUs; (c) for improving conservation translocations; and (d) for studying landscape functional connectivity. We conclude that an epigenetic conservation perspective will provide environmental managers the possibility to refine ESUs, to set conservation plans taking into account the capacity of organisms to rapidly cope with environmental changes, and hence to improve the conservation of wild populations.

To develop meaningful indicators of resilience in SES we need to understand local definitions of resilience. In this paper we describe methods used in a biocultural approach to illuminate sociocultural factors that Pacific Islanders identify as important for resilient communities. We focus specifically on two dimensions of sociocultural factors, Connectedness to People and Place and Indigenous and local knowledges, skills, practices, values and worldviews, which relate to many interventions, but are not usually monitored. We offer examples of indicators that may be appropriate to measure under these dimensions. Increased use of biocultural indicators will bring additional insight on the types and combinations of indicators that work best in given contexts.","[Dacks, Rachel] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Biol, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Ticktin, Tamara] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Bot, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Mawyer, Alexander] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Ctr Pacific Isl Studies, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Caillon, Sophie] Univ Paul Valery Montpellier, Univ Montpellier, EPHE, CEFE UMR 5175,CNRS, Montpellier, France; [Claudet, Joachim] PSL Univ Paris, Natl Ctr Sci Res, CRIOBE, Paris, France; [Claudet, Joachim] Lab Excellence CORAIL, Moorea, French Polynesi, France; [Fabre, Pauline] USR CNRS EPHE LIVD 3278, CRIOBE, BP 1013, F-98729 Moorea, French Polynesi, France; [Jupiter, Stacy D.; McCarter, Joe] Wildlife Conservat Soc, Melanesia Program, Suva, Fiji; [McCarter, Joe; Pascua, Pua'ala; Sterling, Eleanor] Amer Museum Nat Hist, Ctr Biodivers & Conservat, New York, NY 10024 USA; [Mejia, Manuel] Nat Conservancy Hawaii, Marine Program, Honolulu, HI USA; [Wongbusarakum, Supin] NOAA, Ecosyst Sci Div, Pacific Isl Fisheries Sci Ctr, Honolulu, HI USA",rdacks@hawaii.edu,74,21,23,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",,CONSERV SCI PRACT,Conserv.

Renosterveld is one of the most critically endangered habitats in the biologically unique Cape Floristic Region, South Africa. For the first time, we map and synthesize the current state of knowledge on renosterveld ecology and conservation. We investigated 132 studies for the themes, locations and taxa of renosterveld research and the fragmentation, threats, recommendations and barriers to renosterveld conservation. More studies focused on plants than any other taxa (48% of articles) and are conducted mostly in larger, intact renosterveld fragments. The most commonly identified threat to renosterveld was agricultural intensification; conservation recommendations spanned improved farming practices, formal protection and local patch management. Conservation implementation has been piecemeal and has depended largely on the goodwill of landowners, which can be constrained by costs of conservation measures and a lack of suitable restoration means. Citizen science is a promising potential solution to some barriers. Fragmented knowledge in such a transformed and relatively densely populated region highlights the scale of knowledge gaps for other biodiversity hotspots and has implications for ongoing conservation work.","[Topp, Emmeline N.; Loos, Jacqueline] Leuphana Univ Luneburg, Fac Sustainabil Sci, Inst Ecol, Univ Allee 1, D-21335 Luneburg, Germany; [Topp, Emmeline N.] Georg August Univ, Dept Crop Sci, Agroecol, Grisebachstr 6, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany",emmeline.topp@leuphana.de,90,11,11,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0376-8929,ENVIRON CONSERV,Environ.

From uncertain beginnings in 1958, it is now a mature and important internationally recognised scientific journal focussing on conservation and science in national parks in South Africa and beyond into the African continent. After an overview of the emergence of national parks in the 20th century, this retrospective essay reflects on Koedoe's long and significant contribution to the field of national parks research and management. We identify and make easily available some of the seminal and influential articles that have appeared in the journal over this long time span. Principally relating to matters in national parks in South Africa, these articles (some coming from special issues of Koedoe) have been chosen for their variety as well as for the broader perspectives they open into the longer trajectory of national park conservation and management. Articles illustrate the evolution of paradigms from protectionist and species centric, to ecosystem focus, to complex socio-ecological systems and adaptive management. Conservationists, scientists and managers alike will benefit from an understanding of the transformations in their field over six decades together with appreciating the importance and usefulness of unpacking the intellectual journey of national park science in order to contextualise and enrich - even encourage and direct - present and future research. Conservation implications: The articles included in this essay produced important information that informed and guided later research. Introducing these contributions to a fresh audience we hope will also tempt readers to consult other back issues of this journal, which will benefit conservation by providing an understanding of the long-term transformations in the field.","[Carruthers, Jane] Univ South Africa, Dept Hist, Pretoria, South Africa; [Carruthers, Jane; Foxcroft, Llewellyn C.] Stellenbosch Univ, Ctr Invas Biol, Stellenbosch, South Africa; [Foxcroft, Llewellyn C.] South African Natl Pk, Conservat Serv, Skukuza, South Africa",llewellyn.foxcroft@sanparks.org,21,1,1,AOSIS,CAPE TOWN,"POSTNET SUITE 55, PRIVATE BAG X22, TYGERVALLEY, CAPE TOWN, 00000, SOUTH AFRICA",0075-6458,KOEDOE,Koedoe,2019,"Green Published, gold",

This political ecological analysis of tourism in the Ecuadorian Amazonian presents ethnographic vignettes to account for the ways that interwoven global discourses related to biodiversity conservation and community development are encountered, contested, and leveraged to advance particular approaches to tourism at the local level. We invoke Tsing's theory of friction to frame these discursive encounters in the context of tourism-related decision-making in the community of Misahualli, including instances of discursive shifts being leveraged into improved well-being of local residents. This paper makes an important contribution to the scholarship on the political ecology of tourism by bringing the emic perspectives of local residents to the forefront and by demonstrating the value of Tsing's friction metaphor for analyzing the global connections inherent in tourism.

In most cases, this is misleading as wilderness environments have been exploited, explored and also converted into administrative units in various protected area networks. Indeed, most wilderness areas have been a part of human-environment interactions for a long time and they have been influenced and modified in that interaction. As a result, wilderness is constitutively a cultural and politically loaded idea. While the Western notion of wilderness as a place where man himself is a visitor who doesn't remain represents the global hegemonic conservation thinking, it does not necessarily work with different local realities, meanings and use values of the wild. In addition, in recent decades, the tourism industry has placed an increasing interest on nature-based and adventure tourism products creating new kinds of ideas and use needs for the remaining wilderness environments. This paper analyzes empirically how wilderness environments and their roles are seen in the context of new and traditional anthropogenic uses and meanings of wilderness areas. More specifically, the paper uses a political ecology approach to evaluate the use and management priorities in the Finnish Wilderness system.","[Saarinen, Jarkko] Univ Oulu, Geog Res Unit, Oulu, Finland; [Saarinen, Jarkko] Univ Johannesburg, Sch Tourism & Hospitality, Johannesburg, South Africa",jarkko.saarinen@oulu.fi,106,13,13,CHANNEL VIEW PUBLICATIONS,CLEVEDON,"FRANKFURT LODGE, CLEVEDON HALL, VICTORIA ROAD, CLEVEDON, BS21 7HH, ENGLAND",0966-9582,J SUSTAIN TOUR,J.

Manta rays present a prominent example of such species, the populations of which are declining globally due to directed fishery, by-catch, and other anthropogenic stressors. Our goal was to explore manta ray aggregation sites in the Philippines in order to determine the factors governing the mantas' visits - a knowledge gap essential to understand manta ecology, facilitate ecosystem-based fishery management, and promote sustainable manta-based ecotourism. Diving surveys, environmental conditions assessment, and autonomous cameras were employed to study manta behavior and visit patterns to a cleaning station cluster on a commonly fished seamount, visited by both Mobula birostris and Mobula alfredi. Our findings reveal several environmental conditions (e.g., sea state, moon illumination, and flow) that serve as predictors of manta presence/absence at the site. We suggest that these conditions affect both the behavior of the manta's food (i.e., the spatial distribution of plankton) and the cleaning effectiveness of the cleaner wrasse, which consequently influence manta activity. The findings suggest a trade-off between cleaning and foraging: i.e., mantas tend to visit the cleaning stations when environmental conditions are less favorable for foraging but suitable for effective cleaning; while being absent from the cleaning stations when environmental conditions form plankton aggregations, ideal for efficient feeding. This study sheds light on manta behavior and habitat use on dynamic, small spatio-temporal scales (i.e., hundreds of meters to a few kilometers, hours to days). The acquired data may be applied in the planning of marine protected areas and in fishery management (e.g., to reduce the chances of manta bycatch by limiting fishing activities to periods of manta absence) as well as contribute to enhancing sustainable exploitation, such as ecotourism, by increasing the chances of diving encounters with manta rays.","[Barr, Yotam; Abelson, Avigdor] Tel Aviv Univ, Sch Zool, Tel Aviv, Israel",yotamanta@gmail.com,79,7,7,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,FRONT MAR SCI,Front.

Biodiversity conservation was found to be the most frequently stated aim (67% of the cases), followed by recreation and tourism (62%). The planning processes for cultural and ecological landscape corridors were dominated by similar, quite narrow, stakeholder groups, but via a wide variety of approaches and tools. Ecological corridors existed at larger and more variable scales relative to cultural landscape corridors.

Data from the non-protected areas (non-PAs) surrounding the nature reserve network served as a baseline for comparison. We found that some indexes of ecological restoration in the nature reserve network were superior to those in the non-PAs, such as average annual vegetation coverage and net primary production. After the establishment of the nature reserve network, ecosystem water retention service increased by 72% compared to those in the non-PAs. In the non-PAs, intensified or new degradation occurred due to overgrazing and over-exploitation. In recent years, the wetting and warming climate has been the main driver of ecological restoration in the region. The establishment of the nature reserve networks and the implementation of conservation projects both promote the improvement of local ecosystems. Therefore, for alpine regions under climate variability, we should protect entire regions rather than specific areas, and management efforts should focus on long-term sustainable conservation rather than emergency rescue.","[Huang, Lin; Shao, Quanqin; Liu, Jiyuan] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Key Lab Land Surface Pattern & Simulat, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China",huanglin@lreis.ac.cn,56,8,10,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1470-160X,ECOL INDIC,Ecol.

Depth, substrate types and latitude have been shown to account for species differences in demersal faunal assemblages including fish, crustaceans, and cephalopods. The extremely narrow shelf between Tombwa (15 degrees 48'S) and Benguela (12 degrees 33'S) may serve as a barrier for the spreading of shelf-occurring species between the far south, which is influenced by the Angola-Benguela Front, and the equatorial waters of the central and northern areas. A similar pattern is evident for coastal and shallow-water species, including fishes, intertidal invertebrates and seaweeds, with species that have temperate affinities found in the far south and tropical species further to the north. In general the fauna and flora of the littoral zone appears to be consistent with a pattern of relatively low diversity of the shore and near-shore areas, that is characteristic of West Africa, but paucity of data for Angola may make such comparisons of diversity with other areas inappropriate at this stage. The Congo River delta and many features that are interspersed along the coast such as estuaries and associated floodplains, wetlands, lagoons, salt marshes and mangroves, support a rich suite of species, many of which are rare, endemic, migratory, and/or threatened, and provide important ecosystem services. While the ecological value of many areas or features is recognised, lack of any legal protection in the form of marine protected areas (MPAs) has been identified as one of the main challenges facing conservation and sustainable use of Angola's marine and coastal biodiversity and habitats, in the face of multiple threats. A current process to identify and describe ecologically or biologically significant marine areas (EBSAs) could provide a foundation for designating some MPAs in future.","[Kirkman, Stephen P.] Dept Environm Affairs Oceans & Coastal Res, Cape Town, South Africa; [Nsingi, Kumbi Kilongo] Benguela Current Convent, Swakopmund, Namibia",skirkman@environment.gov.za; kkilongo@gmail.com,48,6,6,SPRINGER NATURE SWITZERLAND AG,BASEL,"PICASSOPLATZ 4, BASEL, CH-4052, SWITZERLAND",,,,2019,hybrid,

Suitable sleeping areas may therefore represent important resources for winter survival. Knowledge of microhabitat use and potential impacts of anthropogenic habitat modification can aid species conservation through development of targeted habitat management plans. Wild, endangered Barbary macaques (Macaca sylvanus) in logged cedar-oak forest were studied to investigate (1) the hypothesis that macaques select winter sleeping areas with microhabitat characteristics that may reduce thermoregulatory costs, and, if so, (2) how to minimize damage to sleeping areas from logging. Macaques slept only in Atlas cedars (Cecirus atlantica). Consistent with predictions, macaques preferred sleeping in sheltered topography and dense vegetation, which may reduce exposure to wind, precipitation and cold, and preferred large trees that facilitate social huddling. This suggests that Barbary macaques employ strategic nocturnal microhabitat selection to reduce thermoregulatory costs and thus suitable sleeping areas may influence winter survival. To minimize negative impacts of logging on macaque sleeping areas, results suggest avoiding logging in topographical depressions and maintaining cedar densities greater than 250 ha(-1) with average breast height greater than 60 cm. This study demonstrates how animal behaviour can be used to guide species-specific habitat management plans.","[Campbell, Liz A.

We employ a Bayesian structural time series approach to estimate the effect of introducing EFT in comparison to a simulated counterfactual time series. Quantitative results show a significant increase in the ratio of municipal and national PA designations following Portugal's EFT introductionwhich we infer to be a causal consequence.

Ecological niche models (ENMs) are frequently used to show modern ranges and forecast future range changes. These models, however, assume that a species will exhibit niche conservatism, though this is rarely tested. Here, we examine a woodpecker species with a well-documented recent range expansion to assess the effectiveness of predictive models by comparing the pre- and post-expansion climate/habitat niche using ENMs and multivariate principal components analysis. Occurrence data for the Red-bellied Woodpecker (Melanerpes carolinus) were obtained from the pre-expansion (1910-1939; n = 299) and post-expansion (1980-2009; n = 868) time periods. Ecological niche models were constructed using GIS layers describing climate data and crop cover for the pre- and post-expansion time periods. We then used the pre-expansion ENM to forecast the distribution of Red-bellied Woodpeckers into the post-expansion time period, and vice versa, and calculated the niche overlap of the projected distributions and the actual distributions in those time periods to determine whether pre- and post-expansion niches were similar. Predictive ENMs did not closely match the actual distributions in the pre- and post-expansion time periods, respectively, and the pre-expansion and post-expansion niches were significantly different from each other (Schoener's D = 0.745, P < 0.001). Multivariate analyses revealed that the present-day niche encompasses the past niche and that Red-bellied Woodpeckers today have broader temperature and precipitation tolerances and are found in both more- and less-forested areas than they were in the pre-expansion era. Our analyses reveal that Red-bellied Woodpeckers are not exhibiting climate or habitat niche conservatism, explaining why predictive ENMs for this species could not effectively track their range shift. This study emphasizes that predictive models may not be effective for species undergoing niche changes.","[FitzGerald, Alyssa M.; Starkloff, Naima C.; Kirchman, Jeremy J.] New York State Museum & Sci Serv, Dept Ornithol, 3140 Cultural Educ Ctr, Albany, NY 12230 USA; [FitzGerald, Alyssa M.; Starkloff, Naima C.] SUNY Albany, Dept Biol Sci, 1400 Washington Ave, Albany, NY 12222 USA; [FitzGerald, Alyssa M.] NOAA, Southwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, 110 McAllisterWay, Santa Cruz, CA 95060 USA",alyssa.fitzgerald@noaa.gov,48,0,0,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2150-8925,ECOSPHERE,Ecosphere,2018,gold,

However, an increasing number of large dams worldwide are old and not operating properly. The removal of large dams has excellent potential to restore habitat connectivity and flow regimes; therefore, projecting the related ecological consequences is an emerging need for water resource and ecosystem management. However, no modeling methods are currently available for such projections at the basin scale. We devised a scheme that integrates changes in flow regimes and habitat network structure into a basin-scale impact assessment of removal of large dams and applied it to the Nagara-Ibi Basin, Japan. We used a graph-theoretical approach and a hydrological model, to quantify changes in habitat availability for 11 freshwater fishes at the basin scale under multiple removal scenarios. We compared these results with the change predicted using a conventional scheme that considered only changes to the habitat network due to dam removal. Our proposed scheme revealed that an increase in flow variability associated with dam removal projected both positive and negative effects on basin-scale habitat availability, depending on the focal species, endangered species had a negative response to dam removal. In contrast, the conventional approach projected only positive effects for all species. This difference in the outcomes indicates that large-dam removal can have negative and positive effects on watershed restoration due to changes in flow regimes. Our results also suggest the effect of removal of large dams may depend on the dams and their locations. Our study is the first step in projecting ecological trade-offs associated with the removal of large dams on riverscapes at the basin scale and provides a foundation for future process-based watershed restoration.","[Ishiyama, Nobuo; Sueyoshi, Masanao; Terui, Akira; Nakamura, Futoshi] Hokkaido Univ, Grad Sch Agr, Dept Forest Sci, N9 W9, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0608589, Japan; [Ryo, Masahiro] Free Univ Berlin, Inst Biol, Altensteinstr 6, D-14195 Berlin, Germany; [Ryo, Masahiro; Kataoka, Taiga] Tokyo Inst Technol, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Meguro Ku, 2-12-1-M1-4 Ookayama, Tokyo 1520033, Japan; [Nagayama, Shigeya] Gifu Univ, River Basin Res Ctr, 1-1 Yanagido, Gifu 5011193, Japan; [Terui, Akira] Univ Minnesota, Dept Ecol Evolut & Behav, Gortner Lab 140, 1479 Gortner Ave, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; [Mori, Terutaka] Univ Tokyo, Dept Gen Syst Studies, Meguro Ku, Tokyo 1538902, Japan; [Akasaka, Takumi] Obihiro Univ Agr & Vet Med, Lab Conservat Ecol, Nishi 2 Sen 11, Obihiro, Hokkaido 0808555, Japan",night7mare@gmail.com,46,7,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0888-8892,CONSERV BIOL,Conserv.

The presented approach includes (1) an investigation of the popularity and versatility of woody species in the local people, (2) an estimation of the ecological availability of useful tree species in the forest and (3) identification of local priority species for conservation. We focused the study on the Wari-Maro forest reserve in the Sudanian zone of Benin as an example to implement such approach and identify useful priority species for sustainable conservation and management strategies development. Ethnobotanical surveys were conducted with people in surrounding villages of the forest composed by different sociocultural groups. Floristic vegetation surveys were performed within the forest to assess the local ecological availability of used woody species. A principal component analysis was performed to analyze the versatility, the popularity and the ecological availability of species. Spearman's correlation test was used to assess relation between variables. In total, 79 woody species were reported for seven main types of uses: technology, construction, medicinal, veterinary, food, forage and energy. Among them, 35 were most popular and versatile, and 3 were characterized as priorities for conservation especially regarding their less availability and more versatility. We discussed the used approach by the underlining importance of integrating wood uses or multiples uses in conservation priorities setting and conservation decision-making of useful woody tree species.","[Ahoyo, Carlos C.; Houehanou, Thierry D.; Yaoitcha, Alain S.; Assogbadjo, Achille E.; Adjahossou, Christian S.

Engaging the conceptual flexibility of 'biocultural diversity', we studied nature-based tourism at the intersection of indigenous communities and the digital realm. We employed a political ecology perspective to examine online and offline representations of biocultural diversity in the Brazilian Pantanal, one of the biggest wetlands in the world, and home to groups of peoples known as the Pantaneiros. Data from interviews with 48 stakeholders in the tourist sector were structured along three 'myths'-the Uncivilised, Unrestrained, and Unchanged-for which we have also constructed counter narratives. Each myth denoted the primacy of biodiversity, and ignored broader dimensions of the Pantanal as a bioculturally diverse landscape. The relationships of the Pantaneiros with their environment were found to be intricate and had clear repercussions for tourism, but ironically, reference to the Pantaneiro culture in nature-based tourism was superficial. Moreover, thriving on the myths, this form of tourism perpetuates skewed power structures and social inequalities. Lower-class Pantaneiros likely suffer most from this. We recommend stakeholder engagement with a biocultural design that facilitates the integration of other-than-biodiversity values, and that thereby promotes sustainability of the entire social-ecological system.","[Arts, Koen] Wageningen Univ & Res, Forest & Nat Conservat Policy Grp, NL-6708 PB Wageningen, Netherlands; [Arts, Koen; Girard, Pierre] Pantanal Res Ctr, BR-78068360 Cuiaba, Brazil; [Oliveira Rabelo, Maiara Thaisa; de Figueiredo, Daniela Maimoni] Univ Fed Mato Grosso, Postgrad Program Water Res, BR-78060900 Cuiaba, Brazil; [Maffey, Georgina] JIVE, Oude Hoogeveensedijk 4, NL-7991 PD Dwingeloo, Netherlands; [Ioris, Antonio Augusto Rossotto] Cardiff Univ, Sch Geog & Planning, Glamorgan Bldg,King Edward VII Ave, Cardiff CF10 3WA, S Glam, Wales",koen.arts@wur.nl; tha.rabelo@hotmail.com; dani_figueiredo@uol.com.br; ginazoo@outlook.com; IorisA@cardiff.ac.uk; pierregirard1301@gmail.com,84,11,11,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,2018,"Green Accepted, gold, Green Submitted",

We confronted these perceptions to available data locally and globally. Furthermore, we explored local ideas to improve waterbird survival. Associations between informant variables and trends in water quality were tested using the chi(2) test while multiple correspondence analyses were used to explore drivers, mechanisms, and impacts of bird trends. Wildfowl were cited the most (48.7% of all citations), probably linked to their use as food, and they were negatively driven by human predation but would increase when left to follow natural processes. Changes in natural processes and wetlands drove large piscivores into decline, but their populations would increase when predation was controlled. Generalist species responded positively when climate and resources were not limiting. We then discus the feasibility of the suggested waterbird conservation remedies: education, increasing surface water, law enforcement, sustainable use guidelines, and modified drinking troughs for large herbivores. Local knowledge and available local trends data were inconsistent with International Union for the Conservation of Nature trend status. The local sources of knowledge were not correlated but broadly consistent.

This suggests that Landsat images have the potential to indicate ecologically relevant environmental and biotic variation in the forests also at the extent of the entire basin. However, the full potential of Landsat data for these purposes has not yet been exploited in ecological and biodiversity research or in conservation applications. This is largely because the artifactual noise that is introduced by atmospheric and directional effects into multi-scene composite images can swamp the subtle spectral differences between different types of primary forest. Here, we present a new Landsat TM/ETM+ image composite for the entire Amazon biome that largely overcomes these problems. It is based on more than 16000 individual image acquisitions from the 10-year period 2000-2009. The images were individually processed to directionally and topographically normalized surface reflectance and combined into 2.5 degree tiles using the medoid compositing criterion. Visual inspection showed that the resulting image composite is radiometrically clearly more consistent than other currently available Landsat composites. We tested the ecological relevance of the new Landsat composite by comparing its reflectance values with edaphic properties measured in more than 300 field sampling localities spread across 2000km of Amazonia. We found a strong correlation between observed and predicted concentration of exchangeable base cations in the surface soil, which indicates that the compositing approach has succeeded in removing most of the artifactual noise. The Landsat composite image should be of great value for a multitude of applications in ecology, biodiversity research and conservation planning that require environmental data layers combining detailed spatial resolution, basin-wide coverage and high radiometric accuracy.","[Van doninck, Jasper; Tuomisto, Hanna] Univ Turku, Dept Biol, Amazon Res Team, FI-20014 Turku, Finland",jasper.vandoninck@utu.fi,57,16,16,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN, NJ 07030 USA",,REMOTE SENS ECOL CON,Remote Sens.

The turtle dove (Streptopelia turtur) is a vulnerable species that has undergone a rapid and serious decline across its distribution range. I investigated the effect of different variables at two spatial scales (10-m radius, nest site; and 100-m radius, landscape) on the probability of presence of turtle dove nests in an agroforestry system of Central Morocco. Topography, habitat structure, human disturbance, and land use parameters were measured at nests (n = 70) and random points (n = 70) at both scales. Generalized linear model analyses showed that, at the nest site scale, tree height best explained occurrence of turtle dove nests (with nest occurring preferentially in smaller trees). At the landscape scale, nest occurrence probability decreased with elevation and distance to the nearest forest edge, and increased with forest cover and distance to the nearest habitation. Comparison of explanatory power of the single-scale models showed that the most relevant scale was the nest site level, followed by landscape scales, but the model including both nest-scale and landscape-scale variables was best. The variation partitioning analysis confirmed this pattern. In study area, the turtle dove nest habitat selection process occurs within a relatively small scale, but the joint effect of variables at the two scales is relevant. From a practical perspective, it would be interesting to reproduce the same experimental approach on other Mediterranean breeding habitats (agricultural and other forest habitats) to find out if this species would adopt the same nest habitat selection pattern.","[Hanane, Saad] Forest Res Ctr, High Commiss Water Forests & Desertificat Control, Ave Omar Ibn El Khattab,BP 763, Rabat 10050, Morocco",sdhan333@gmail.com,73,7,8,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1612-4642,EUR J WILDLIFE RES,Eur.

This study was conducted with Adi community of Arunachal Pradesh (Ar P) state in the Eastern Indian Himalayas to understand as how local systems of forest classification governs conservation tradition and influences subsistence livelihoods. Twenty Adi villages were sampled from East Siang district of Ar P. A total of 197 men and 204 women (total of 401) Adi respondents were selected for this study. A combination of methodologies including in-depth interview, transect walks, focus group discussion, participant observation and informal interactions were combined for data collection. Results: Local forests are classified into 10 different categories based on indicators such as topography, cultural significance, use typology, ownership rights and plant diversity indicators. Local people assign different values (economic, cultural and ecological) to different forest types. Overall, morang followed by regpi and homegardens are perceived to be more valuable to the local needs than other forests with relative ranking of a particular forest reflecting its sustainability. Adis access several diverse services from these community-managed forests. Compared to men (3-35%), the role of women was assessed to be much higher (65 to 100%) in conserving forest biodiversity. Woman-led practices, instrumental in sustainable forest management, included deliberate manipulations of micro-habitats, sustainable harvesting strategies and species domestication. Men were mostly involved in ownership and decision-making roles and in devising social norms to ensure sustainability. Adi celebrate a number of cultural events to sustain biodiversity. Forest-based livelihoods are intrinsically connected to forest resource conservation and are governed by community approaches. Most of the community members gather plants, hunt wild animals and access other ecosystem services from these forests to sustain their livelihoods. Community-owned forests are collectively managed by an indigenous institution `Kebang'. Conflicts relating to forest land use and resource management are resolved by the customary chief `Gaon Burha' and his associates using traditional norms. Conclusions: Adi's system of forest classification, based on ecological, socio-cultural and livelihood indicators, is a location-specific yet comprehensive in nature. Study suggests that integrating the local indicators applied in classifying and strategies applied in managing the local forests can provide valuable insights to the policy makers for the sustainable conservation of forest resources.","[Singh, Ranjay K.; Hussain, Shah M.; Riba, T.] Cent Agr Univ, Coll Hort & Forestry, Pasighat 791102, Arunachal Prade, India; [Singh, Ranjay K.; Singh, Anshuman; Bhardwaj, Ajay Kumar] ICAR Cent Soil Salin Res Inst, Karnal 132001, Haryana, India; [Padung, Egul] Doying Gumin Coll, Pasighat, Arunachal Prade, India",ranjaysingh_jbp@rediffmail.com,53,8,9,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",,ECOL PROCESS,Ecol.

Recent research on ecological subsidies-the transfer of energy and nutrients from one ecosystem to another-has highlighted the importance of nutrient exchange for maintaining productivity and diversity at a landscape scale, while also pointing toward the fragility of ecotones and vulnerability of subsidies to human activities. We review the recent literature on landscape connectivity and ecosystem subsidies from aquatic systems to terrestrial systems. Based on this review, we propose a conceptual model of how human activities may alter or eliminate the flow of energy and nutrients between ecosystems by influencing the delivery of subsidies along the pathway of transfer. To demonstrate the utility of this conceptual model, we discuss it in the context of case studies of subsidies derived from salmon, marine mammals, sea turtles, sea birds, and shoreline debris. Subsidy restoration may require a different set of actions from simply reversing the pathway of degradation. We suggest that effective restoration and conservation efforts will require a multifaceted approach, targeting many steps along the subsidy transfer pathway, to address these issues.","[Buckner, Emily V.; Hernandez, Daniel L.] Carleton Coll, Dept Biol, 1 North Coll St, Northfield, MN 55057 USA; [Buckner, Emily V.] 3324 E Laurelhurst DR NE, Seattle, WA 98105 USA; [Samhouri, Jameal F.] Natl Ocean & Atmospher Adm, Conservat Biol Div, Northwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, 2725 Montlake Blvd East, Seattle, WA 98112 USA",embuckner@gmail.com; dhernand@carleton.edu; jameal.samhouri@noaa.gov,94,5,5,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0044-7447,AMBIO,Ambio,2018,Green Published,

The first step to reach this goal is to identify suitable areas for restoration. Here, we advocate for the restoration of roadsides, an often neglected landscape that is usually degraded. Using Brazil as an example, we calculate the potential of roadside restoration for carbon storage, and discuss other additional positive environmental impacts. We show that in Brazil more than 566 thousand hectares of roadsides along federal and state highways are potentially available for restoration. This corresponds to a sequestration of up to 55.3 million tons of carbon, representing up to US$26.5 billion in the carbon market. Additional benefits would include erosion control, prevention of landslides, increased landscape value, pollinator habitat provisioning, and contribution to biodiversity conservation. We push for roadside restoration for its many environmental benefits and other practical reasons: roadsides in Brazil are governmentally owned, reducing the needing for negotiations with stakeholders in proposed interventions. Roadside restoration, however, is unlikely to re-establish predisturbance ecosystem conditions in all cases, but it may significantly contribute to biodiversity conservation, for instance, by providing habitat and increasing ecological connectivity for specific taxa and biomes. Thus, the restoration of roadsides in Brazil represents an immense potential for carbon sequestration, with other important environmental benefits. Proper management is necessary, and concrete strategies and goals in restoration planning will vary among different Brazilian biomes. The restoration of these currently undervalued public lands can make the financial and environmental benefits of land restoration evident to stakeholders and thus stimulate ecological restoration.

Conservation managers work within a political-ecological system when they develop and attempt to implement a conservation plan that is designed to meet particular conservation goals. In this article, we develop a decision support tool that can identify a conservation policy for a managed wildlife population that is both sustainable and politically feasible. Part of our tool consists of a simulation model composed of interacting influence diagrams. We build, fit, and use our tool on the case of rhino horn trafficking between South Africa and Asia. Using these diagrams, we show how a rhino poacher's belief system can be modified by such a policy and locate it in a perceived risks-benefits space before and after policy implementation. We statistically fit our model to observations on group actions and rhino abundance. We then use this fitted model to compute a politically feasible conservation policy.","[Haas, Timothy C.] Univ Wisconsin, Lubar Sch Business, 3202 N Maryland Ave, Milwaukee, WI 53201 USA; [Ferreira, Sam M.] SANParks, Sci Serv, ZA-1350 Skukuza, South Africa",haas@uwm.edu,86,11,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1051-0761,ECOL APPL,Ecol.

Conflict between conservation objectives and human livelihoods is ubiquitous and can be highly damaging, but the processes generating it are poorly understood. Ecological elements are central to conservation conflict, and changes in their dynamics - for instance due to anthropogenic environmental change - are likely to influence the emergence of serious human-wildlife impacts and, consequently, social conflict. 2. We used mixed-effects models to examine the drivers of historic spatio-temporal dynamics in numbers of Greenland barnacle geese (Branta leucopsis) on the Scottish island of Islay to identify the ecological processes that have shaped the environment in which conflict between goose conservation and agriculture has been triggered. 3. Barnacle goose numbers on Islay increased from 20,000 to 43,000 between 1987 and 2016. Over the same period, the area of improved grassland increased, the number of sheep decreased and the climate warmed. 4. Goose population growth was strongly linked to the increasing area of improved grassland, which provided geese with more high quality forage. Changing climatic conditions, particularly warming temperatures on Islay and breeding grounds in Greenland, have also boosted goose numbers. 5. As the goose population has grown, farms have supported geese more frequently and in larger numbers, with subsequent damaging effects on grassland. The creation of high-quality grassland appears to have largely driven the problem of serious economic damage by geese. Our analysis also reveals the drivers of spatial variation in goose impacts: geese were more likely to occur on farms closer to roosts and those with more improved grassland. However, as geese numbers have increased they have spread to previously less favoured farms. 6. Synthesis and applications. Our study demonstrates the primary role of habitat modification in the emergence of conflict between goose conservation and agriculture, alongside a secondary role of climate change. Our research illustrates the value of exploring socio-ecological history to understand the processes leading to conservation conflict. In doing so, we identify those elements that are more controllable, such as local habitat management, and less controllable, such as climate change, but which both need to be taken into account when managing conservation conflict.","[Mason, Tom H.

However, many social ecological systems depend on human interventions to maintain characteristics of biological diversity. Therefore, reduced use or full abandonment of such systems can diminish rather than enhance biological diversity and its related cultural diversity (biocultural diversity). We link the definition of underuse with the extinction rate used in the planetary boundaries framework to support a more objective use of the term. We execute a structured cross-continental review of underuse in social-ecological systems of regions that contain more affluent countries to frame a global research agenda on underuse. Our working approach delineates causes, consequences, and strategies concerning underuse. Based on this comparative review, we identify causes of underuse that are similar in different continents, including globalization, and demographic or structural change in Europe, Japan and Oceania. Conservation paradigms emphasizing wilderness ideals in policies are characteristic of underuse in North America, whereas post-socialist transformation processes characterize underuse in Eastern Europe. Land abandonment and de-intensification of use are a common result, particularly in marginal and protected areas. Consequences of the loss of biocultural diversity include the loss of ecosystem services, traditional knowledge, or landscape amenities. We identified a pervasive gap in transcontinental comparative research that stymies the development of effective strategies to reduce underuse of biological diversity and thereby maintain related cultural diversity. We advocate for a global research agenda on governance approaches that address the challenges of underuse. Within this agenda, we emphasize the need for an international cross-case synthesis and a trans-continental mapping of state and civil society-based interventions and co-management approaches to re-establish humans as parts of ecological systems. Such comparative work on best practice cases in a real-world context should enhance adaptive management of biocultural diversity and prevent extinction caused by underuse. Thus, this innovative connection between underuse and the planetary boundary extinction rate, along with our new global research agenda on underuse, should initiate much needed support for policy makers and natural resource managers who must decide on appropriate types and levels of human intervention to implement, both inside and outside of protected areas.","[Mauerhofer, V.] Meiji Univ, Org Strateg Coordinat Environm Res, Environm Law Ctr, Tokyo, Japan; [Ichinose, T.] Keio Univ, Fac Environm & Informat Studies, Endo 5322, Fujisawa, Kanagawa 2520882, Japan; [Blackwell, B.

The current presence of both species in Mexico and the rest of Latin America remains uncertain in the absence of dedicated studies. During 2015, we performed the first nationwide study of sawfishes in Mexico. We developed specific materials to survey fishers, raise community awareness, and publicize sawfish conservation needs. We interviewed 794 fishers in 71 localities along the Atlantic and Pacific coasts of Mexico. Additional data from a similar 2010-2011 survey of 39 fishers in Tabasco and Campeche were also included in the analysis. Both species might be nearly extirpated from Mexico. Interviewees reported modal decadal dates of last sighting as the 1980s for the smalltooth sawfish along the Atlantic coast and as the 1970s for the largetooth sawfish along both coasts. No confirmed reports of recent (<5 yr) sightings were reported. However, a live juvenile smalltooth sawfish was caught in Veracruz in January 2016. Historical importance maps were reconstructed, indicating that both species were distributed along the entire surveyed area; the smalltooth sawfish was especially common in Campeche, Quintana Roo, and Tabasco, while the largetooth sawfish was common in Campeche, Colima, and Chiapas. Both species must be re-categorized in Mexican legislation for species at risk of extinction from 'threatened' to 'endangered'.","[Bonfil, Ramon; Ricano-Soriano, Melina; Uriel Mendoza-Vargas, Oscar; Bolano-Martinez, Nataly; Palacios-Barreto, Paola] Oceans Vivientes AC, Cerrada Monserrat 9, Mexico City, DF, Mexico; [Ricano-Soriano, Melina] Revoluc 9,Sect Pajaritos, Tihuatlan 92902, Veracruz, Mexico; [Uriel Mendoza-Vargas, Oscar] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Posgrad Ciencias Biol, Mexico City 04510, DF, Mexico; [Mendez-Loeza, Ivan; Carlos Perez-Jimenez, Juan] E1 Colegio Frontera Sur, Unidad Campeche, Campeche 24500, Campeche, Mexico; [Bolano-Martinez, Nataly; Palacios-Barreto, Paola] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Ciencias Mar & Limnol, Mexico City 04510, DF, Mexico; [Palacios-Barreto, Paola] Fdn Colombiana Invest & Conservat Tiburones & Ray, SQUALUS, Calle 10A 72-35, Cali, Colombia",ramon.bonfil@oceanosvivientes.org,43,8,9,INTER-RESEARCH,OLDENDORF LUHE,"NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY",1863-5407,ENDANGER SPECIES RES,Endanger.

Lodge and shrine structures were heavily damaged and more than 60 climbers lost their lives as a pyroclastic flow engulfed the mountain's summit. Humans have long dwelled on and around Ontake-san, maintaining their livelihoods through farming, gathering, and hunting. The mountain has also been the focus of religious devotion and spiritual training for hundreds of years, and spiritual practitioners still visit the mountain regularly. However, in the modem era, Ontake-san and its surrounding environment has also been a site of resource development and exploitation, including industrial forestry, dam building, and tourist recreation. Thus, the mountain occupies, and its eruption occurred within, a landscape of contested meanings and values embodied by various entities and materially inscribed through their actions and interactions. In this article I employ an affective ecology framework to consider Ontake-san's eruption as an interruptive 'destabilizing moment' within which new trajectories and life projects may emerge. I argue that the affective qualities of local life projects present challenges to dominant modes of conservation, resource development, and capital accumulation.","[Cunningham, Eric J.] Earlham Coll, Japanese Studies Program, Richmond, IN 47374 USA",cunnier@earlham.edu,36,3,3,MEDKNOW PUBLICATIONS & MEDIA PVT LTD,MUMBAI,"B-9, KANARA BUSINESS CENTRE, OFF LINK RD, GHAKTOPAR-E, MUMBAI, 400075, INDIA",0972-4923,CONSERV SOC,Conserv.

The description of their ecology is crucial to determine their survival status and successful reproduction for conservation purposes. In this study, we assessed the microhabitat preferences of Tylototriton yangi at the type locality, Gejiu, Yunnan province, China, with the Visual Encounter Survey method and by using new important materials. The main habitat is located within a humid subtropical climate and is composed of a large karstic mountain containing some patch of secondary mixed forests and plantations such as tomato fields, pepper and cabbage that are surrounded by scrubs, grasses and small ponds. We provided a complete diagnosis with new morphological data analysing ten adult individuals from the type series to establish a formal description which is absent from the first original description. We compared our results with other related taxa of the genus Tylototriton to updated key determinants between similar species. Thus, we analysed the population structure and the behaviour of T. yangi during a period of ten years, 2008-2017, to assess its survival status and to determine the main threat factors. A total of 186 specimens were found during the whole study predicting a small population inhabiting the type locality, Gejiu. Consequently, T. yangi is now regarded as a highly threatened species that need more attention of Chinese authorities and we suggest regarding it as Endangered due to its small distribution range, the low number of adult specimens observed and ongoing exploitation.","[Hernandez, Axel] Univ Pasquale Paoli Corsica, Corte, France; [Hou, Mian] Sichuan Normal Univ, Chengdu, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Hou, Mian] Shenyang Normal Univ, Shenyang, Liaoning, Peoples R China",hernandez.axel.1989@gmail.com,47,1,2,SARANSK FOND PODDERZKI & RAZVITIA ZAPOVEDNYH,SARANSK,"SUMMER LANE, BUILDING 4,, SARANSK, REPUBLIC OF MORDOVIA 430007, RUSSIA",2500-008X,NAT CONSERV RES,Nat.

The southern Darwin's frog, R. darwinii, is found in the temperate forests of southern South America, is listed as Endangered and could be the only extant representative of this genus. Based on stomach contents, invertebrate prey availability and stable isotope analysis, we determined for the first time trophic ecological parameters for this species. Our results showed that R. darwinii is a generalist sit-and-wait predator and a secondary consumer, with a trophic position of 2.9. Carbon and nitrogen isotope composition indicated that herbivore invertebrates are their main prey, detected in 68.1 % of their assimilated food. The most consumed prey included mosquitoes, flies, crickets, grasshoppers and ants. Detritivore and carnivore invertebrates were also ingested, but in lower proportions. Our results contribute to a better understanding of the feeding habits of this fully terrestrial amphibian and provide the first insight into their role linking low forest trophic positions with intermediate predators. We provide valuable biological information for in situ and ex situ conservation which can be used when developing habitat protection, reintroduction and captive breeding programmes. As revealed here, stable isotope analysis is a valuable tool to study the trophic ecology of highly endangered and cryptic species.","[Molina-Burgos, Blanca E.; Alvarado-Rybak, Mario] Univ Andres Bello, Fac Ciencias Vida, Programa Doctorado Med Conservac, Santiago 8370251, Chile; [Molina-Burgos, Blanca E.; Valenzuela-Sanchez, Andres; Alvarado-Rybak, Mario; Klarian, Sebastian; Soto-Azat, Claudio] Univ Andres Bello, Fac Ciencias Vida, Ctr Invest Sustentabilidad, Santiago 8370251, Chile; [Valenzuela-Sanchez, Andres; Soto-Azat, Claudio] ONG Ranita Darwin, Santiago 8330240, Chile; [Valenzuela-Sanchez, Andres] Univ Austral Chile, Fac Ciencias, Inst Ciencias Ambientales & Evolut, Avda Rector Eduardo Morales S-N, Valdivia 5090000, Chile; [Klarian, Sebastian] Univ Andres Bello, Fac Ecol & Recursos Nat, Ctr Invest Marina Quintay, Vina Del Mar 2531015, Chile; [Klarian, Sebastian] Univ Andres Bello, Lab Anal Isotop, Vina Del Mar 2531015, Chile",blancaestela.molina@gmail.com; csoto@unab.cl,63,4,4,INTER-RESEARCH,OLDENDORF LUHE,"NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY",1863-5407,ENDANGER SPECIES RES,Endanger.

Worldwide, forests are managed by one of two broad approacheseven- and uneven-aged silviculture. In recent decades, there has been rising public pressure against the systematic use of even-aged silviculture (especially clear-cutting) because of its perceived negative esthetic and ecological impacts. This led to an increased interest for uneven-aged silviculture. However, to date, there has been no worldwide ecological comparison of the two approaches, based on multiple indicators. Overall, for the 99 combinations of properties or processes verified (one study may have evaluated more than one property or process), we found nineteen (23) combinations that clearly showed uneven-aged silviculture improved the evaluated metrics compared to even-aged silviculture, eleven (16) combinations that showed the opposite, and 60 combinations that were equivocal. Furthermore, many studies were based on a limited study design without either a timescale (44 of the 76) or spatial (54 of the 76) scale consideration. Current views that uneven-aged silviculture is better suited than even-aged silviculture for maintaining ecological diversity and processes are not substantiated by our analyses. Our review, by studying a large range of indicators and many different taxonomic groups, also clearly demonstrates that no single approach can be relied on and that both approaches are needed to ensure a greater number of positive impacts. Moreover, the review clearly highlights the importance of maintaining protected areas as some taxonomic groups were found to be negatively affected no matter the management approach used. Finally, our review points to a lack of knowledge for determining the use of even- or uneven-aged silviculture in terms of both their respective proportion in the landscape and their spatial agency.","[Nolet, Philippe] Univ Quebec Outaouais, Inst Sci Foret Temperee ISFORT, Ripon, PQ, Canada; [Kneeshaw, Daniel] Univ Quebec Montreal, Dept Sci Biol, Ctr Etud Foret CEF, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Messier, Christian] Univ Quebec Outaouais UQO, Dept Sci Nat, Inst Sci Foret Temperee ISFORT, Ctr Etud Foret CEF, Ripon, PQ, Canada; [Beland, Martin] Univ Moncton, Ecole Foresterie, Campus Edmundston, Edmundston, NB, Canada",philippe.nolet@uqo.ca,70,33,33,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

This easily accessible, low-cost tool is improving existing research methods and enabling novel approaches in marine turtle ecology and conservation. Here we review the diverse ways in which incorporating inexpensive UAVs may reduce costs and field time while improving safety and data quality and quantity over existing methods for studies on turtle nesting, at-sea distribution and behaviour surveys, as well as expanding into new avenues such as surveillance against illegal take. Furthermore, we highlight the impact that high-quality aerial imagery captured by UAVs can have for public outreach and engagement. This technology does not come without challenges. We discuss the potential constraints of these systems within the ethical and legal frameworks which researchers must operate and the difficulties that can result with regard to storage and analysis of large amounts of imagery. We then suggest areas where technological development could further expand the utility of UAVs as data-gathering tools; for example, functioning as downloading nodes for data collected by sensors placed on turtles. Development of methods for the use of UAVs in sea turtle research will serve as case studies for use with other marine and terrestrial taxa.","[Rees, Alan F.; Broderick, Annette C.; Tilley, Dominic; Varela, Miguel R.; Godley, Brendan J.] Univ Exeter, Marine Turtle Res Grp, Ctr Ecol & Conservat, Coll Life & Environm Sci, Penryn Campus, Penryn TR10 9FE, Cornwall, England; [Avens, Larisa] NOAA, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Southeast Fisheries Ctr, Beaufort Lab, Beaufort, NC 28516 USA; [Ballorain, Katia] Biodivers French Agcy, Marine Nat Pk Mayotte & Glorieuses, Reunion Isl, France; [Ballorain, Katia] CARA Ecol, Reunion Isl, France; [Bevan, Elizabeth; Wibbels, Thane] Univ Alabama Birmingham, Dept Biol, Birmingham, AL 35294 USA; [Carthy, Raymond R.] US Geol Survey, Florida Cooperat Fish & Wildlife Res Unit, Gainesville, FL USA; [Christianen, Marjolijn J.

A novel approach to achieving these goals determines the relative proportions of vegetation growth stages (equivalent to successional stages, which are categorical representations of time since fire) that maximize a biodiversity index. The method combines data describing species abundances in each growth stage with numerical optimization to define an optimal growth-stage structure that provides a conservation-based operational target for managers. However, conservation targets derived from growth-stage optimization are likely to depend critically on choices regarding input data. There is growing interest in the use of growth-stage optimization as a basis for fire management, thus understanding of how input data influence the outputs is crucial. Simulated data sets provide a flexible platform for systematically varying aspects of survey design and species inclusions. We used artificial data with known properties, and a case-study data set from southeastern Australia, to examine the influence of (1) survey design (total number of sites and their distribution among growth stages) and (2) species inclusions (total number of species and their level of specialization) on the precision of conservation targets. Based on our findings, we recommend that survey designs for precise estimates would ideally involve at least 80 sites, and include at least 80 species. Greater numbers of sites and species will yield increasingly reliable results, but fewer might be sufficient in some circumstances. An even distribution of sites among growth stages was less important than the total number of sites, and omission of species is unlikely to have a major influence on results as long as several species specialize on each growth stage. We highlight the importance of examining the responses of individual species to growth stage before feeding survey data into the growth-stage optimization black box, and advocate use of a resampling procedure to determine the precision of results. Collectively, our findings form a reproducible guide to designing ecological surveys that yield precise conservation targets through growth-stage optimization, and ultimately help sustain biodiversity in fire-prone systems.","[Sitters, Holly; Di Stefano, Julian; Swan, Matthew; York, Alan] Univ Melbourne, Sch Ecosyst & Forest Sci, 4 Water St, Creswick, Vic, Australia; [Wills, Timothy] GHD, Level 8,180 Lonsdale St, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",holly.sitters@unimelb.edu.au,58,6,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1051-0761,ECOL APPL,Ecol.

In this chapter, I highlight important ingredients of Norton's adaptive management framework and synthesize some of the key findings that resulted from applying some of the key elements of Norton's adaptive management framework in the field setting of addressing the wicked problem of tropical deforestation in Tanzania, Vietnam and Peru through a MacArthur Foundation funded project (2006-2011). The following specific problem formulation and valuation issues are explored in this chapter: space-time boundaries; identification of stakeholder values; weights on stakeholder values; and decision rule choice. We discovered that many wicked problems surrounding environmental management persist in the field settings due to the stakeholder power asymmetries, conflicting values, politics of scale across different space time horizons and institutional inertia. I propose that institutional designs and governance processes operating at different levels of the space-time hierarchy-ranging from a person's ambit to their community, city, state, country and planetary scales-must also be examined and addressed for adaptive management in social ecological systems.","[Zia, Asim] Univ Vermont, Dept Community Dev & Appl Econ, 146 Univ Pl,Morrill 208E, Burlington, VT 05405 USA",Asim.Zia@uvm.edu,60,1,1,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10013, UNITED STATES",1570-3010,INT LIBR ENVIRON AGR,,2018,,

Predictions can be more accurate if changes in physiological characteristics of species due to those changes are included. Thus, we aimed to evaluate the impacts of climate change on the different hierarchical levels of Apuleia leiocarpa (Vogel) J. F. Macbr. (Fabaceae). Therefore, we experimentally evaluate the effect of different temperatures on the initial development (vigor) and estimate the impact of climate change on the potential geographic distribution of the species, using ecological niche approaches. For the experiment, we used 11 temperature intervals of 2 degrees C ranging from 21 to 41 degrees C. We used ecological niche modeling techniques (ENM) to predict the species' environmental suitability in future climate scenarios. The association between the experiment and niche models was obtained by testing the relationships of temperature increase on the species vigor and geographic distribution. This conceptual model to determine the direct and indirect effects of temperature was generated using the methodological framework of structural equation models. The experiment showed that the seeds had the highest growth at 31 degrees C. ENMs indicated that due to climate change, there is a tendency for the plant to migrate to regions with milder temperatures. However, such regions may be unsuitable for the plant since they do not have ideal temperatures to germinate, which may cause a drastic reduction in their availability in a future climate change scenario. The inclusion of seed germination through experimental research allowed us to detect an area that is less suitable for germination despite being climatically suitable for the species. Thus, research that integrates the effect of climate on the different stages of the organism's development is essential to understand the impact of climate change on biodiversity.","[Ferreira, Rafael Batista; de Arruda, Filipe Viegas; Nabout, Joao Carlos] Univ Estadual Goias, Campus Cent,BR 153, BR-31057513 Anapolis, Go, Brazil; [Ferreira, Rafael Batista] Fac Metropolitana Anapolis, Av Fernando Costa 49,Vila Jaiara St Norte, BR-75064780 Anapolis, Go, Brazil; [Parreira, Micael Rosa] Univ Fed Goias, Campus Samambaia,Av Esperanca S-N, BR-74690900 Goiania, Go, Brazil; [de Arruda, Filipe Viegas] Inst Pesquisa Ambiental Amazonia, Asa Norte CLN 211,BL B Sala 201, BR-70863520 Brasilia, DF, Brazil; [Falcao, Marcus J.

In a 1-year study of two groups of Olalla's titi monkey (Plecturocebus olallae) in the fragmented forests of the Llanos de Moxos, Bolivia, we assessed seasonal variations in behavior, ranging, and diet to examine their ecological flexibility. We observed groups in the wet and dry seasons, recording behavior with instantaneous group scan sampling (743.5 observation hours in the dry season and 733.0 hours in the wet season) and ranging and feeding data with all occurrence sampling. At the same time, we collected data on food availability via monthly phenology monitoring. The titi monkeys fed mainly on fruits and significantly reduced the time they spent consuming fruit during the dry season compared with the wet season while showing some (nonsignificant) increase in their consumption of leaves, and other foods (seeds, lichens, and fungi). Home ranges remained relatively constant, but titi monkeys spent less time moving in the dry season than in the wet season, although this difference was not significant. The observed shift in diet toward consuming alternative foods during the fruit lean period and reducing movement instead of expanding ranging behavior to look for higher-quality foods suggests that P. olallae follows an energy-area minimizing strategy that may enable these primates to inhabit fragmented forests. Nevertheless, deforestation and further fragmentation in the range of these endemic and Critically Endangered primates must be addressed, as they represent significant threats to the severely range-restricted P. olallae populations. Our study illustrates the relevance of understanding primate ecological flexibility in response to food reductions to the development of conservation actions, especially in the light of increasing forest degradation and loss in the study region.","[Martinez, Jesus; Wallace, Robert B.; Domic, Enrique; Lopez, Lesly] Wildlife Conservat Soc, Casilla 3-35181 SM, La Paz, Bolivia; [Martinez, Jesus; Nekaris, K.

Podocarpus angustifolius, a tree endemic to Cuba, is potentially threatened by overexploitation, deforestation and expansion of exotic species. In December of 2017, in two protected areas containing the only known subpopulations of this species, we recorded the geographical position, height, and diameter at breast height of each individual, and calculated the extent of occurrence (EOO) and area of occupancy (AOO). We recorded a total of 575 individuals, 174 of which were adult (defined as >= 6 m height on the basis of the occurrence of reproductive structures), and most of which occurred in Lomas de Banao Ecological Reserve. The EOO and AOO were 125.8 km(2) and 6.0 km(2), respectively. All P. angustifolius that remain in the wild are within two protected areas, either in rainforest relicts or in coffee plantations. The size structure indicates a growing population. Based on our findings we recommend that P. angustifolius should be recategorized from Vulnerable (on the IUCN Red List) and Critically Endangered (on the national Red List) to Endangered, based on criterion D (small population size). We recommend the continued reinforcement of the population at Topes de Collantes Natural Protected Landscape and the continued engagement of local stakeholders for the long-term conservation of this species.","[Teste, Ernesto; Becquer, Eldis R.] Univ La Habana, Jardin Bot Nacl, Carretera El Rocio Km 3 1-2, Havana 19230, Cuba; [Hernandez, Majela] Univ La Habana, Fac Biol, Dept Biol Vegetal, Havana, Cuba; [Valle, Oliver] Empresa Nacl Protecc Flora & Fauna, Reserva Ecol Lomas Banao, Banao, Sancti Spiritus, Cuba; [Gonzalez-Torres, Luis R.] Douglas Coll, Dept Biol, New Westminster, BC, Canada",etestelozano@gmail.com,8,0,0,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0030-6053,ORYX,Oryx,2022,gold,

Ecological networks (ENs) are a comprehensive control scheme to protect regional ecological sustainability. However, in the current research about ENs, most studies can only determine the orientation of ecological corridors but not their specific spatial range. This leads to the fact that ENs can only be abstract concepts composed of points and lines, and cannot be implemented into concrete spatial planning. In this study, taking the Shandong Peninsula urban agglomeration as an example, ecological sources were identified by morphological spatial pattern analysis (MSPA) and habitat quality assessment, ecological resistance surfaces were constructed based on habitat risk assessment (HRA). And circuit theory was used to simulate the ecosystem processes in heterogeneous landscapes via by calculating the cumulative current value and cumulative current recovery value, to identify the spatial range and key areas of ecological corridors. The results showed that the ENs includes 6,263.73 km(2) of ecological sources, 12,136.61 km(2) of ecological corridors, 283.61 km(2) of pinch points and 347.51 km(2) of barriers. Specifically, ecological sources were distributed in a spatial pattern of five groups, and ecological corridors were short and dense within groups, long in distance and narrow in width between groups. The pinch points and barriers mainly exist in the ecological corridors connecting the inner and outer parts of the central city and in the inter-group corridors. In order to ensure the connectivity and effectiveness of ENs, it is necessary to focus on the pinch points and barriers and include them in the priority areas for protection and restoration. Based on MSPA and circuit theory, this study provides a new method for determining the spatial range of ENs and the specific locations of priority areas, and provides a feasible solution for the concrete implementation of ENs to achieve effective ecological protection and restoration.","[Zhai, Tianlin] Henan Agr Univ, Coll Resources & Environm Sci, Zhengzhou, Peoples R China; [Huang, Longyang] Wuhan Univ, Sch Resource & Environm Sci, Wuhan, Peoples R China",hly@whu.edu.cn,56,0,0,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",2296-701X,FRONT ECOL EVOL,Front.

Earlier, the IUCN assessed the conservation status of these species as: P. urichi, Endangered (EN); P. charlottevillensis, Least Concern (LC); P. turpinorum, Vulnerable (VU). However, these assessments were based on very little field-based evidence. Here, we present survey results which contributed to reassessments as LC, VU and Data Deficient for these three species, respectively. Despite the close proximity of Trinidad to northern Venezuela, the islands do not share any Pristimantis species with the mainland, which holds a rich endemicity of Pristimantis regionally. In this study, we used genetic sequencing from several island populations and compared them to northern Venezuelan endemics to assess genetic divergence for the first time. The time tree analyses found that only the northern Tobago species P. turpinorum is closely related to mainland Pristimantis, with a genetic split dating to the Late Miocene, suggesting a vicariant event of mainland and island species. Pristimantis urichi, although identical between the two islands, remains highly divergent from the mainland species. Similar results were found for P. charlottevillensis. In addition, there was a high level of divergence between P. urichi and P. charlottevillensis. These findings indicate different island colonization events by different lineages. Sequencing other Venezuelan species remains pivotal to unravel the complexity of the colonization episodes in the region, likely influenced by the changing topography and multiple connection and isolation episodes of the islands by eustatic sea-level changes.","[Jowers, Michael J.] Univ Porto, Ctr Invest Biodiversidade & Recursos Genet, CIBIO InBIO, Campus Agrario Vairao, P-4485661 Vairao, Portugal; [Sanchez-Ramirez, Santiago] Univ Toronto, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Greener, Mark S.; Harper, Lynsey R.; Marshall, Trudie; Thomson, Robyn; Byrne, Isabel; Loughrey, Ciara F.; Graham, Leah; McGhee, William A.

However, the distribution pattern of biodiversity hotspots and their conservation status remain unclear. Based on 148,283 high-resolution occurrence coordinates of 13,450 seed plants, we identified hotspots by integrating data from species richness, species complementarity and spatial phylogenetics. Nine hotspot areas were identified that contained 89% of species but covered only 7% of the total land area of the QTP. Four of nine hotspots were identified firstly, including west Nyainqentanglha Mountains, the middle reaches of Lancang and Jinsha Rivers, the upper reaches of Yellow River and Qilian Mountains. Analysis of conservation efficiency indicated national nature reserves (NNRs) covered 55% of the hotspots, whereas NNRs and provincial nature reserves (PNRs) together protected 73% of the hotspots. Conservation efforts, such as establishing new protected areas and upgrading the level of existing nature reserves, should be strengthened in the conservation gaps. Targeted conservation should be carried out for species endemic to QTP due to their narrow distribution range and low conservation effectiveness. Niche modeling for 336 threatened plants indicated there were apparent range shifts of suitable habitat areas from the eastern edge to the center of the plateau under future climate scenarios, and conservation priority should be focused on the southern QTP for where have stable habitats.","[Xue, Tiantian; Yang, Xudong; Li, Jin; Xia, Changying; Yu, Shengxiang] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Bot, State Key Lab Systemat & Evolutionary Bot, Beijing 100093, Peoples R China; [Xue, Tiantian; Yang, Xudong; Li, Jin; Yu, Shengxiang] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Gadagkar, Sudhindra R.] Midwestern Univ, Coll Grad Studies, Biomed Sci Program, Glendale, AZ 85308 USA; [Gadagkar, Sudhindra R.] Midwestern Univ, Coll Vet Med, Glendale, AZ 85308 USA; [Albright, Thomas P.] Univ Nevada, Dept Geog, Lab Conservat Biogeog, Reno, NV 89557 USA; [Albright, Thomas P.] Univ Nevada, Program Ecol Evolut & Conservat Biol, Reno, NV 89557 USA; [Xia, Changying] Southwest Univ, Sch Life Sci, Chongqing Key Lab Plant Resource Conservat & Germ, Chongqing 400715, Peoples R China; [Wu, Jianyong] Nanjing Inst Environm Sci, Minist Ecol & Environm Peoples Republ China, Nanjing 210042, Peoples R China",yushengxiang@ibcas.ac.cn,86,1,1,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",,GLOB ECOL CONSERV,Glob.

To conserve these species, it is necessary to apply methods that identify habitats suitable for their survival. Until now, a comprehensive method has not been developed for predicting the occurrence of species associated with old, hollow trees. Here, we developed criteria to identify habitats for organisms associated with old, hollow trees, using Osmoderma barnabita as a model species. We used hexagonal tessellation to identify suitable habitats for hermit beetle. Criteria for predicting the occurrence of a hermit beetle were applied in practise, and as result 47.56% of the known hermit beetle localities coincided with the hexagons where the probability of occurrence of the species was the highest. Based on these results, an ecological network was created for species dependency on old, hollow trees, using the hermit beetle as a model species. The proposed approach makes it possible to plan and implement environmental protection measures for species living in territories spanning several countries.

These efforts can be facilitated by compiling the main research topics related to conservation biology to provide new evidence for the most urgent knowledge gaps, and publicise it to researchers, research funders and policy makers. We used the possible future statements from the Hungarian Environmental Foresight Report for 2050 which identified region-specific problems. To highlight likely future environmental and conservation questions, in this study we asked researchers from the fields of ecology and conservation to define research questions addressing these future statements in line with international research trends and challenges. The study resulted in fourteen priority research topics, split into seven clusters relevant to biological conservation that should be targeted by stakeholders, primarily policy makers and funders to focus research capacity to these topics. The main overarching themes identified here include a wide range of approaches and solutions such as innovative technologies, involvement of local stakeholders and citizen scientists, legislation, and issues related to human health. These indicate that solutions to conservation challenges require a multidisciplinary approach in design and a multi-actor approach in implementation. Although the identified research priorities were listed for Hungary, they are in line with European and global biodiversity strategies, and can be tailored to suit other Central and Eastern European countries as well. We believe that our prioritisation can help science-policy discussion, and will eventually contribute to healthy and well-functioning ecosystems.","[Csakvari, Edina] ELKH Ctr Ecol Res, Inst Ecol & Bot, Restorat Ecol Res Grp, Alkotmany U 2-4, H-2163 Vacratot, Hungary; [Fabok, Veronika; Kovacs-Hostyanszki, Aniko; Baldi, Andras] ELKH Ctr Ecol Res, Inst Ecol & Bot, Lendulet Ecosyst Serv Res Grp, Alkotmany U 2-4, H-2163 Vacratot, Hungary; [Bartha, Sandor; Molnar, Zsolt; Odor, Peter] ELKH Ctr Ecol Res, Inst Ecol & Bot, Alkotmany U 2-4, H-2163 Vacratot, Hungary; [Barta, Zoltan] Univ Debrecen, Dept Evolutionary Zool, MTA Behav Ecol Res Grp, Egyetem Ter 1, H-4032 Debrecen, Hungary; [Batary, Peter; Botta-Dukat, Zoltan] ELKH Ctr Ecol Res, Inst Ecol & Bot, Lendulet Landscape & Conservat Ecol Res Grp, Alkotmany U 2-4, H-2163 Vacratot, Hungary; [Borics, Gabor; Lengyel, Szabolcs] ELKH Ctr Ecol Res, Inst Aquat Ecol, Karolina Ut 29, H-1113 Budapest, Hungary; [Eros, Tibor] Balaton Limnol Res Inst, Klebelsberg Kuno U 3, H-8237 Tihany, Hungary; [Gaspar, Judit; Hideg, Eva; Marton, Andras] Corvinus Univ Budapest, Fovam Ter 8, H-1093 Budapest, Hungary; [Sramko, Gabor] MTA Lendulet Evolutionary Phylogen Res Grp, Debrecen, Hungary; [Standovar, Tibor] Eotvos Lorand Univ, Dept Plant Systemat Ecol & Theoret Biol, Pazmany P Setany 1-C, H-1117 Budapest, Hungary; [Liker, Andras] Univ Pannonia, MTA PE Evolutionary Ecol Res Grp, H-1158 Veszprem Pf, Hungary; [Magura, Tibor] Univ Debrecen, Dept Ecol, Egyetem Ter 1, H-4032 Debrecen, Hungary; [Molnar, V.

The human-induced impacts have a pivotal role in the discussion about the cause of these extinctions events. Although researchers are nearly unanimous about the current biodiversity crisis, there is still a debate about how these human-induced impacts affect biodiversity across different geographical scales. While our perception about landscape modification promoted by deforestation occurs at local scales, we treat the increase of greenhouse gas emissions and its consequences in a global perspective. This diffuse view about different processes but potential assembling properties illustrates the importance of combining small and broad-scales to improve our conservation actions and decelerate extinction events. Here, we propose an integrated framework (Ecoland) combining landscape ecology and macroecology for niche modelling applications, aiming to disentangle the effects of human-induced impacts on biodiversity and guide conservation tasks at multiple scales. We demonstrated the EcoLand application using a dataset of fruit-feeding butterfly species occurrence from the Atlantic Forest. Our findings highlight the impact of the land-use modification on the number of butterfly species. Finally, we discuss the method implications, its limitations and perspectives, and how it the Ecoland can help us to design conservation strategies aiming at the maintenance of biodiversity and its related policy practices.

The objectives of our research were to study spring cricket frog movements, habitat use, and life history to better inform management decisions for this state-listed endangered species. We also experimented with marking techniques. We used visual encounter surveys to investigate its ecology and phenology, and marking (e.g., toe-clipping) surveys and photographic identification to investigate individual and group movements. We documented movements from overwintering (e.g., rivers and streams) to breeding (e.g., wetlands and lakes) locations from mid-April to June in southwestern Wisconsin, USA. We did not always detect migrations away from overwintering sites on the river. Most female movements occurred after males had moved to breeding locations. Marking and photographing individuals was successful in verifying movement distances up to 662 m, suggesting that individual cricket frogs can be effectively identified over a one-month span by using this approach. Our results suggest that Blanchard's Cricket Frog spring movements in southwestern Wisconsin occur predominantly along waterbody corridors linking overwintering to breeding habitat. Conservation plans should incorporate use of these movement corridors into habitat management actions to enhance preservation of the species.","[Badje, Andrew F.; Bergeson, Tara L.; Paloski, Rori A.] Wisconsin Dept Nat Resources, Bur Nat Heritage Conservat, 101 South Webster St,POB 7921, Madison, WI 53707 USA; [Brandt, Tyler J.] Wisconsin Dept Nat Resources, Bur Forestry Business Serv, 101 South Webster St,POB 7921, Madison, WI 53707 USA; [Kapfer, Joshua M.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Biol Sci, Upham Hall,Room 352, Whitewater, WI 53190 USA",andrew.badje@wisconsin.gov,41,0,0,HERPETOLOGICAL CONSERVATION & BIOLOGY,CORVALLIS,"C/O R BRUCE BURY, USGS FOREST & RANGELAND, CORVALLIS, OR 00000 USA",2151-0733,HERPETOL CONSERV BIO,Herpetol.

Cut-slope soils are infertile, creating unfavourable conditions for plant growth and a reduction of plant species. We investigated plant communities and species regeneration at a cut-slope area in Malaysia whilst examining the relationship between species diversity and soil erosion. Experimental plots were set at three different vegetation coverage intensities; 0% (A), 10% (B), and 50% (C). Treatment C recorded the highest plant coverage, plant density, species richness, plant diversity, and evenness index over time. In contrast, as there was no vegetation at the start of the experiment, succession rate was the highest in treatment A (bare plot) followed by B and C. The succession rate was lower in C due to high competition between the existing plant communities for space, nutrients, sunlight and water. The plot with the highest vegetation coverage (C) showed improved slope stability for it recorded a significant reduction in soil saturation level and erosion rate whilst increasing the shear strength. Dicranopteris linearis, a fern species was the most dominant species in all treatments for it is a pioneer species that thrives in harsh environment. High plant diversity was effective in enhancing soil properties thus, improving soil shear strength as plant coverage increased.

We draw on five decades of monitoring by the Amboseli Conservation Program to illustrate the rainfall-plant-herbivore linkages in a free-ranging wildlife-livestock system transitioning to contemporary savanna landscapes. In half a century, the coupled interactions of wildlife and livestock in the Amboseli ecosystem driven by rainfall and water sources have been severed and reshaped by farming, land subdivision, sedentism, poaching, and intensified herbivory. Livestock ranges have expanded, wildlife ranges have contracted, and overlapping spatial use has fluctuated with population sizes. In contrast, wildlife and livestock herds have been sustained where the rangelands remain open. A decrease in the mean body size reflecting a shift to small stock among pastoralists has increased species dominance, decreased diversity, and elevated biomass turnover and the probability of extreme shortfalls. In recent droughts, pastoralists have been importing food supplements to reduce drought risk and purchased livestock to restock herds, further uncoupling the rainfall-herbivore link. Our study reinforces the view that biomes worldwide are shaped at an accelerating pace by human agencies rather than endogenous environmental factors. Disputes over models of rangeland systems echo the wider debate over using natural ecosystems as benchmarks for conservation verses gardening nature. We argue that models of natural ecosystems fail to account for the dominant role of humans in contemporary ecosystem yet that it is possible to monitor the complex interplay of human and natural systems and interpret the changes in terms of ecological function using macroecological analysis. The key finding for conservation is the importance of space, landscape heterogeneity, social networks, and mobility in sustaining the large herbivore populations.","[Western, David; Mose, Victor N.] African Conservat Ctr, Nairobi 1528900509, Kenya",vnmose@gmail.com,128,0,0,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2150-8925,ECOSPHERE,Ecosphere,2021,gold,

Fishery pressure and lack of knowledge, especially where these elasmobranch fish overlap their habitats off developing countries in the Indo-West Pacific, impede their biological conservation which in turns result in unnoticed population depletion. Rhino rays are an important component of the Bangladeshi artisanal fishery; however, an understanding of these fisheries and their trade is limited. Fishers and traders were interviewed between June 2018 and June 2019 in four areas of southeast Bangladesh to characterize rhino ray fishing, trade and fishers' perception of population trends. All interviewed fishers reported life-long rhino ray catch in sizable numbers and noted a steep decline in the catch over time, especially for Rhynchobatus spp. Seven species were documented- not only targeted by un-baited longlines but also by-caught in gillnets and set-bag nets. Unregulated and undocumented catch fuelled by substantial international trade to Myanmar on highquality skin, meat and fins; and national usages of meat, liver, cartilages and intestines. Between 9000 and 33000 kg (avg. 23000 kg) of rhino rays were bought annually by each trader during 2015-2018. Southcentral shallow-water char (sand island) areas are perceived as essential habitats, hence providing important fishing grounds. The predominant threats are overexploitation by unselective gear use, bottom trawling, target catch, international trade and source of protein and income. Compliance with international trade control treaties or the Bangladeshi law was low, with most fishers (78%) unaware of specific regulation regarding rhino rays. It is crucial to adopt precautionary principles to prevent further rhino ray population declines. We propose a combination of actions rooted in sustainability and inclusiveness in this regard; e.g. a) trade mitigation, monitoring and enforcement, b) need for sustainable fisheries management regimes, c) need for habitat protection; finally, d) the importance of fishers' inclusiveness in conservation decision making.","[Haque, Alifa Bintha; Hossain, Nazia] Univ Dhaka, Dept Zool, Dhaka 1000, Bangladesh; [Washim, Mahi; D'Costa, Nidhi Gloria; Baroi, Amit Robert; Nanjiba, Rifah; Khan, Nazmul Ahsan] North South Univ, Dhaka, Bangladesh; [Hasan, Shanur Jahedul] Bangladesh Fisheries Res Inst, Marine Fisheries & Technol Stn, Dhaka 4700, Bangladesh",alifa.haque@du.ac.bd,95,2,2,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0964-5691,OCEAN COAST MANAGE,Ocean Coastal Manage.,2021,,

Here we combine previous results on the genetic diversity of a suitable model species (the diploid Cyperus fuscus) with new data on its historical and recent occurrence, its ecological and climatic niche, and the associated vegetation. Analysis of phytosociological releves from Central Europe revealed a broad ecological niche of C. fuscus with an optimum in the Isoeto-Nanojuncetea class, extending to several other vegetation types. Overall species composition in the releves highlight C. fuscus as a potential indicator of habitat conditions suitable for a range of other threatened taxa. Analysis of historical records of C. fuscus from the Czech Republic showed an increasing trend in the number of localities since the 1990s. It seems that recent climate warming allows the thermophilous C. fuscus to expand its range into colder regions. Isoeto-Nanojuncetea and Bidentetea species are well represented in the soil seed bank in both riverine and anthropogenic habitats of C. fuscus. Vegetation diversity has a weak negative effect and anthropogenic (compared to riverine) habitats have a strong negative effect on genetic diversity in this species.","[Kur, Pavel] Univ Vienna, Dept Bot & Biodivers Res, Rennweg 14, A-1030 Vienna, Austria; [Pisova, Sona; Hroudova, Zdenka] Czech Acad Sci, Inst Bot, Zamek 1, Pruhonice 25243, Czech Republic; [Pisova, Sona] Austrian Res Ctr Forests, Dept Forest Biodivers & Nat Conservat, Seckendorff Gudent Weg 8, A-1131 Vienna, Austria; [Tremetsberger, Karin; Bockelmann, Jorg; Bernhardt, Karl-Georg] Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci, Inst Bot, Gregor Mendel Str 33, A-1180 Vienna, Austria; [Drevojan, Pavel] Masaryk Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Bot & Zool, Kotlarska 2, Brno 61137, Czech Republic; [Kacki, Zygmunt] Univ Wroclaw, Bot Garden, Sienkiewicza 23, PL-50335 Wroclaw, Poland; [Bockelmann, Jorg] Univ Vienna, Dept Bot & Biodivers Res, Div Trop Ecol & Anim Biodivers, Rennweg 14, A-1030 Vienna, Austria; [Mesterhazy, Attila] Hunyadi Utca 55, H-9500 Celldomolk, Hungary; [Sumberova, Katerina] Czech Acad Sci, Inst Bot, Lidicka 25-27, Brno 60200, Czech Republic",kur.pavel@gmail.com; sonka.krl@gmail.com; karin.tremetsberger@boku.ac.at; pavel.drevojan@seznam.cz; zygmunt.kacki@uwr.edu.pl; joerg.boeckelmann@univie.ac.at; karl-georg.bernhardt@boku.ac.at; zdenka.hroudova@ibot.cas.cz; amesterhazy@gmail.com; katerina.sumberova@ibot.cas.cz,110,1,1,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,WATER-SUI,Water,2021,gold,

Then, the effectiveness for the protection of odonate species of three classes of protected areas (strictly protected area, sustainable use area, and indigenous territory) was evaluated. Approximately 30% of the species are protected within the network of protected areas. These findings highlight the importance of protected areas for safeguarding most odonate species in the Amazon.

Conservation planning, particularly the prioritization of management interventions for forests, is often lacking spatial data on forest degradation, and it is often overlooked within decision-making processes. We develop a continuous metric termed Forest Condition (FC) which aims to measure the degree of forest degradation on a scale from 0 to 100, incorporating the temporal history of forest change over any spatial extent. We parameterize this metric based on estimated changes in above ground biomass in the context of forest fragmentation over time to estimate a continuous measure of forest degradation for Congo Basin countries. We estimate that just <70% of Congo Basin forests remain fully intact, a decrease from 78% in the year 2000. FC was validated by direct remote sensing measurements from Landsat imagery for DRC. Results showed that FC was significantly positively correlated with forest canopy cover, gap area per hectare, and magnitude of temporal change in Normalized Burn Ratio. We tested the ability of FC to distinguish primary and secondary degradation and deforestation and found significant differences in gap area and spectral anomalies to validate our theoretical model. We apply the IUCN Red List of Ecosystems criteria to demonstrate the integration of forest condition to assess the risk of ecosystem collapse. Based on this assessment, we found that without including FC in the assessment of biotic disruption, 12 ecosystems representing over 11% of forested area in 2015 would not have been assigned a threat status, and an additional 9 ecosystems would have a lower threat status. Our overall assessment of ecosystems found about half of all Congo Basin ecosystem types, accounting for 20% of all forest area are threatened to some degree, including 4 ecosystems (<1% of total area) which are critically engendered.

A major goal of our broad-ranging research on orangutan behavior and ecology is to understand how the unique rainforest environment of Southeast Asia, characterized by dramatic changes in fruit productivity due to unpredictable mast fruiting, impacts orangutan behavior, physiology, and health. Much of our research has been devoted to the development of non-invasive techniques and an integrated biology approach ? using hormonal assays, fecal processing, nutritional analysis, genetics, and behavioral ecology ? and has led to an increased understanding of the ecological and evolutionary pressures shaping orangutan adaptations. Our results show that the extended life history and very slow reproductive rate of orangutans are adaptations to their environment. Orangutans in the Gunung Palung landscape, as elsewhere across Borneo and Sumatra, also face a series of conservation challenges, including extensive habitat loss and the illegal pet trade. We highlight how our investigations of orangutan health status, ecosystem requirements, and the assessment of orangutan density using ground and drone nest surveys have been applied to conservation efforts. We describe our project?s direct conservation interventions of public education and awareness campaigns, sustainable livelihood development, establishment of village-run customary forests, investigation of the illegal pet trade, and active engagement with Indonesian government organizations. These efforts, in concert with the development of local scientific and conservation capacity, provide a strong foundation for further conservation as orangutans face a challenging future.","[Knott, Cheryl D.; Kane, Erin E.; Bastian, Meredith L.; Blackburn, Andrea; Brubaker-Wittman, Laura A.; DiGiorgio, Andrea L.; Harwell, Faye S.; O'Connell, Caitlin A.; Robinson, Natalie J.; Scott, Amy M.; Suro, Robert Rodriguez] Boston Univ, Dept Anthropol, 232 Bay State Rd, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Knott, Cheryl D.] Boston Univ, Dept Biol, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Knott, Cheryl D.; Kane, Erin E.; Achmad, Mariamah; Barrow, Elizabeth J.; Beck, Josephine; Breeden, Terri L.; Brousseau, Jennifer J.; Brown, Ella R.; Campbell-Smith, Gail A.; de Sousa, Andrew; Freund, Cathryn A.; Gehrke, Victoria I.; Granados, Alys; Harting, John; Johnson, Andrea; Kanisius, Petrus; Kemsey, James R.; Kurniawan, Sulidra Frederik; Kurniawati, Desi; Laman, Timothy G.; Naruri, Ranti; Philp, Brodie J.; Rahman, Edi; Robinson, Natalie J.; Scott, Katherine S.; Suro, Robert Rodriguez; Tamariska, Frederik Wendi; Yaap, Betsy; Susanto, Tri Wahyu] Gunung Palung Orangutan Conservat Program, Boston, MA USA; [Knott, Cheryl D.; Kane, Erin E.; Achmad, Mariamah; Barrow, Elizabeth J.; Beck, Josephine; Breeden, Terri L.; Brousseau, Jennifer J.; Brown, Ella R.; Campbell-Smith, Gail A.; de Sousa, Andrew; Freund, Cathryn A.; Gehrke, Victoria I.; Granados, Alys; Harting, John; Johnson, Andrea; Kanisius, Petrus; Kemsey, James R.; Kurniawan, Sulidra Frederik; Kurniawati, Desi; Laman, Timothy G.; Naruri, Ranti; Philp, Brodie J.; Rahman, Edi; Robinson, Natalie J.; Scott, Katherine S.; Suro, Robert Rodriguez; Tamariska, Frederik Wendi; Yaap, Betsy; Susanto, Tri Wahyu] Yayasan Palung, Ketapang, West Kalimantan, Indonesia; [Knott, Cheryl D.; Kane, Erin E.; Barrow, Elizabeth J.; Bastian, Meredith L.; Beck, Josephine; Blackburn, Andrea; Brousseau, Jennifer J.; Brown, Ella R.; Brown, Michelle; Brubaker-Wittman, Laura A.; Campbell-Smith, Gail A.; DiGiorgio, Andrea L.; Granados, Alys; Harting, John; Harwell, Faye S.; Johnson, Andrea; Laman, Timothy G.; O'Connell, Caitlin A.; Philp, Brodie J.; Robinson, Natalie J.; Scott, Amy M.; Scott, Katherine S.; Suro, Robert Rodriguez; Yaap, Betsy; Susanto, Tri Wahyu] Cabang Panti Res Stn, Gunung Palung Orangutan Project, West Kalimantan, Indonesia; [Knott, Cheryl D.] Boston Univ, Womens Gender & Sexual Program, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Bastian, Meredith L.] Smithsonians Natl Zoo, Washington, DC USA; [Bastian, Meredith L.] Smithsonians Conservat Biol Inst, Washington, DC USA; [Brittain, Nancy Lou Conklin] Harvard Univ, Dept Human Evolutionary Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Brousseau, Jennifer J.] Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Dept Forest Resources & Environm Conservat, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA; [Brown, Michelle] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Anthropol, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Campbell-Smith, Gail A.] Int Anim Rescue, Ketapang, West Kalimantan, Indonesia; [DiGiorgio, Andrea L.] Princeton Univ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Freund, Cathryn A.] Wake Forest Univ, Dept Biol, Winston Salem, NC 27101 USA; [Granados, Alys] Univ British Columbia, Dept Forest Resources Management, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Laman, Timothy G.] Harvard Univ, Museum Comparat Zool, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Brown, Ella R.; Marshall, Andrew J.] Univ Michigan, Dept Anthropol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [O'Connell, Caitlin A.] Univ Southern Calif, Dept Biol Sci Human & Evolutionary Biol, Los Angeles, CA 90007 USA; [Riyandi] Tanjungpura Univ, Fac Math & Sci, Pontianak, West Kalimantan, Indonesia; [Scott, Katherine S.] Oxford Brookes Univ, Dept Social Sci, Oxford, England; [Setia, Tatang Mitra; Susanto, Tri Wahyu] Univ Nas, Biol Fac, Jakarta, Indonesia; [Setiadi, Wuryantari] Eijkman Inst Mol Biol, Jakarta, Indonesia; [Setiawan, Endro; Sumardi, Ibrahim] Gunung Palung Natl Pk Off, Ketapang, West Kalimantan, Indonesia; [Thompson, Melissa Emery] Univ New Mexico, Dept Anthropol, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA; [Setiawan, Endro] Univ Nas, Grad Sch, Biol Study Program, Jakarta, Indonesia; [Marshall, Andrew J.] Univ Michigan, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Marshall, Andrew J.] Univ Michigan, Program Environm, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Marshall, Andrew J.] Univ Michigan, Sch Environm & Sustainabil, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Harting, John] Pacific Biosci, Menlo Pk, CA USA",knott@bu.edu,116,2,2,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0006-3207,BIOL CONSERV,Biol.

Most studies in marine turtles focused on population genetic structure have been performed at rookeries. We studied whether genetic and morphological variation of the endangered green turtle (Chelonia mydas) is consistent geographically, focusing on foraging grounds. An association between population genetic structure and body shape variation at broad (inter-lineage) and fine (foraging grounds) scales was predicted and analysed using mitochondrial DNA and geometric morphometrics. Although genetic and phenotypic differentiation patterns were congruent between lineages, no fine-scale association was found, suggesting adaptive divergence. Connectivity among Pacific foraging grounds found here suggests that temperatures of ocean surface currents may influence the genetic structure of C. mydas on a broad scale. Our results suggest that vicariance, dispersal, life-history traits and ecological conditions operating in foraging grounds have shaped the intraspecific morphology and genetic diversity of this species. Considering a range of geographic and temporal scales is useful when management strategies are required for cosmopolitan species. Integrating morphological and genetic tools at different spatial scales, conservation management is proposed based on protection of neutral and adaptive diversity. This approach opens new questions and challenges, especially regarding conservation genetics in cosmopolitan species.","[Alvarez-Varas, Rocio; Guerrero, Felipe; Veliz, David] Univ Chile, Fac Ciencias, Dept Ciencias Ecol, Santiago, Chile; [Alvarez-Varas, Rocio; Veliz, David] Univ Catolica Norte, Dept Biol Marina, Nucleo Milenio Ecol & Manejo Sustentable Islas Oc, Coquimbo, Chile; [Alvarez-Varas, Rocio; Medrano, Carol; Guerrero, Felipe] Qarapara Tortugas Marinas Chile Nongovt Org, Santiago, Chile; [Heidemeyer, Maike] Univ Costa Rica, Ctr Invest Biol Celular & Mol CIBCM, San Jose, Costa Rica; [Riginos, Cynthia] Univ Queensland, Sch Biol Sci, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Benitez, Hugo A.] Univ Catolica Maule, Ctr Invest Estudios Avanzados Maule, Talca, Chile; [Resendiz, Eduardo; Lara-Uc, Monica] Univ Autonoma Baja California Sur, Dept Acad Ciencias Marinas & Costeras, La Paz, Mexico; [Godoy, Daniel A.] Massey Univ, Inst Nat & Math Sci, Coastal Marine Res Grp, Auckland, New Zealand; [Pablo Munoz-Perez, Juan; Alarcon-Ruales, Daniela E.] Univ San Francisco Quito USFQ, Univ North Carolina Chapel Hill UNC, Galapagos Sci Ctr GSC, Isla San Cristobal, Galapagos, Ecuador; [Pablo Munoz-Perez, Juan] Univ Sunshine Coast USC, Sunshine Coast, Qld, Australia; [Velez-Rubio, Gabriela M.; Fallabrino, Alejandro] Karumbe Nongovt Org, Montevideo, Uruguay; [Piovano, Susanna] Univ South Pacific, Sch Marine Studies, Suva, Fiji; [Alfaro-Shigueto, Joanna; Ortiz-Alvarez, Clara; Mangel, Jeffrey C.] ProDelphinus, Lima, Peru; [Alfaro-Shigueto, Joanna] Univ Cient Sur, Fac Biol Marina, Lima, Peru; [Esquerre, Damien] Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Biol, Div Ecol & Evolut, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Zarate, Patricia] Inst Fomento Pesquero, Dept Oceanog & Medio Ambiente, Valparaiso, Chile; [Leon Miranda, Fabiola; Vianna, Juliana A.] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Agron & Ingn Forestal, Dept Ecosistemas & Medio Ambiente, Santiago, Chile",rocioalvarez@ug.uchile.cl; dveliz@uchile.cl,85,2,2,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0024-4082,ZOOL J LINN SOC-LOND,Zool.

However, to date, its use as a practical tool for prioritising conservation action is limited. Pangolins are the world's most heavily trafficked wild mammals and all species are in decline. The Philippine pangolin (Manis culionensis) is Critically Endangered but conservation efforts are hindered by a lack of knowledge on where populations still exist and where in situ action should be prioritised. We conducted the first range-wide systematic survey for the species using household interviews (n 1/4 1296) to provide new data on pangolin distribution, status and threats, and to assess the use of LEK for highlighting priority areas for conservation. LEK about pangolins was high (87% of respondents recognised pangolins and provided further information), with evidence of pangolin occurrence in 17 of the 18 municipalities surveyed. The majority (70%) of respondents had seen a pangolin, but most (72%) perceived pangolins to be 'rare' or 'very rare', and local use of pangolins was reported across the species' range. Spatial differences in sighting frequencies, perceived abundance and reported population trends were observed, providing an important baseline to identify priority sites for targeted research and community-based pangolin conservation.

CPs exhibit highly specialised and often very sensitive ecologies, being generally restricted to nutrientimpoverished habitats where carnivory offers a competitive advantage. As such, they are often the first species to disappear following habitat degradation, land use change, and alteration to natural ecological processes, and are at significant risk from processes such as eutrophication and weed invasion, and even poorly-understood impacts such as airborne nitrogen inputs. Many of the world's 860 species of CPs are found in wetland habitats, which represent some of the most cleared and heavily degraded ecosystems on Earth. Global diversity hotspots for CPs are likewise located in some of the most heavily cleared and disturbed areas of the planet-southwestern Western Australia, Southeast Asia, Mediterranean Europe, central eastern Brazil, and the southeastern United States-placing their conservation at odds with human developmental interests. Many carnivorous plant species exhibit extreme range-restriction and are wholly localised to specific geological formations, microhabitats or elevations, with nowhere to move to in the face of environmental change, such as a warming, drying climate. We provide the first systematic examination of the conservation status and threats to all CPs globally, compiling full or partial assessments of conservation status category for 860 species from 18 genera, and provide ten recommendations towards better conservation and management of this iconic group. A total of 69 species were assessed as Critically Endangered (8% of all species), 47 as Endangered (6%), 104 as Vulnerable (12%), and 23 as Near Threatened (3%). Slightly over 60% of CPs (521 species) were assessed as Least Concern. At least 89 species are known from only a single location based on current knowledge. Data on threatening processes were available for 790 species, with the most common threatening processes including Agriculture and Aquaculture (impacting 170 species), Natural Systems Modifications (168 species), Climate Change and Severe Weather (158 species), Energy Production and Mining (127 species), Human Intrusions and Disturbance (126 species), and Biological Resource Use (98 species). Almost a quarter of all species were impacted upon by three or more threatening processes. The most significant threats placing species at imminent risk of extinction include the continuing clearing of natural habitat for urban and agricultural development and the illegal collection of individuals from the wild for horticultural trade. The complex and specialised ecological requirements of CPs, together with the multifaceted threats they face, make conservation difficult and repatriation even to restored areas challenging. As the number of vulnerable, endangered and extinct carnivorous plant species continues to grow, despite significant conservation efforts in many regions and greater awareness of their ecological requirements, it is clear that a paradigm shift is required in our approach to the preservation of this unique group of plants in order to achieve long-term conservation successes.

Grassland and wetland losses in the upper midwestern United States have been extensive, but government-funded conservation programs have protected and restored hundreds of thousands of acres of wetland and grassland habitat in the region.The value of restored wetlands in agricultural fields is complex, and the USDA Natural Resource Conservation Service, Conservation Effects Assessment Project (CEAP) has been lacking the methodology to include these conservation practices in their analyses. Our aim is to develop a reproducible methodology for simulating wetlands within the CEAP cropland modeling framework used to evaluate other agricultural conservation practices. Furthermore, we evaluate the effect of using upland conservation practices on the functioning of restored wetlands. By simulating the addition of a depressional wetland that effectively removes 6% of the field from crop production, we obtained a 15% reduction in annual runoff and a 29% and 28% reduction in mean annual nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) losses, respectively. The presence of the depressional wetland in the field is estimated to also reduce edge-of-field losses of sediments by 20% and sediment-bound N and P by 19% and 23%, respectively. Additionally, adding a grass filter strip around the wetland greatly decreased sediment inputs to the wetland, increasing the effective life of the wetland, in terms of its ability to perform valued services, by decades to centuries. Our method for modeling depressional wetlands embedded in cropped fields provides a means to quantify the effects of wetland conservation practices on field-level losses for regional assessments, such as the CEAP.","[McKenna, O.

The prevalence and ecological consequences of illegal killing are often underestimated or completely unknown. We review the practice of legal recreational shooting and present data gathered from telemetry, surveys, and observations on its association with illegal killing of wildlife (birds and snakes) within conservation areas in Idaho, USA. In total, 33% of telemetered long-billed curlews (Numenius americanus) and 59% of other bird carcasses found with known cause of death (or 32% of total) were illegally shot. Analysis of spatial distributions of illegal and legal shooting is consistent with birds being shot illegally in the course of otherwise legal recreational shooting, but snakes being intentionally sought out and targeted elsewhere, in locations where they congregate. Preliminary public surveys indicate that most recreational shooters find abhorrent the practice of illegal killing of wildlife. Viewed through this lens, our data may imply only a small fraction of recreational shooters is responsible for this activity.

The articles were the result of a 10-year study on the focal species that eventually led to the first reintroduction ofI. malinverniana.The first article described the development of a cost-effective model for the selection of suitable reintroduction sites for the species. The second article provided a summary of the techniques used to reintroduce the species and included techniques of ex situ propagation, recipient site preparation, planting methods, and monitoring. This article reviews the practical conservation actions forI. malinvernianathat followed the publication of twoAQCpapers and how they may affect research and conservation for other quillworts and aquatic macrophytes. The results were surprising and went well beyond the initial expectations of the authors. BothAQCpublications stimulated the conservation ofI. malinvernianafrom different points of view. They contributed by informing scientists and policymakers of the risk of extinction of this species, leading to the establishment of a new protected area in Piedmont (northern Italy). Our published data represent a sound starting point for funding opportunities in the context of the European Union LIFE programme. Further impacts include an expansion of knowledge on oligotrophic habitat management, the assessment of conservation status, and the education of the general public, with the last of these greatly enhanced by the two ex situ collections created in the botanic gardens of Tourin and Pavia.

Low-income rural communities are disproportionately affected by negative interactions with large predators, which often leads to retaliatory killings and persecution of the animals. To overcome this, socio-ecological studies that merge existing knowledge of large predator ecology with long-term livestock depredation monitoring are required. We examined patterns and drivers of livestock depredation in northern Botswana, using a mixed effects model of the government's long-term monitoring data on human-wildlife conflict, to identify ways to reduce depredation at key spatial and temporal scales. We compared the results to farmers' understanding of their personal risk within the landscape. We analysed 342 depredation events that occurred during 2008-2016, using variables measured at different scales. The variables affecting the locations of depredation events at the 2-km scale were distance to protected areas and predator and herbivore density, with increased depredation in the wet season. At a 1-km scale, herbivore density did not have a significant effect, but the effect of other variables was unchanged. The 4-km scale model was influenced by livestock and herbivore density, with increased depredation in the wet season. Livestock depredation could be reduced by establishing an 8-km livestock-free buffer along the protected area boundary. There was disparity between government data on human-wildlife conflict, depredation reported by farmers in interviews and farmers' risk awareness. Farmers would benefit from workshops providing tools to make evidence-based decisions and minimize their risk of negative interactions with wildlife. This would ultimately contribute to wildlife conservation in the Kavango-Zambezi Transfrontier Conservation Area.","[Dunnink, Jeffrey A.; Franco, Aldina M.

To meet this accelerating demand, people are harvesting it at unsustainable rates and trading it across Nepal through both legal and illegal means. It is therefore imperative to understand the socio-ecological interactions regarding the current distribution, use, trade, and conservation of P. polyphylla, in order to guide its sustainable production in the future. Methods: In this study, we employed both qualitative and quantitative methodology to collect data from primary and secondary sources. We first carried out extensive field surveys and informal interviews with key stakeholders across 51 of the 77 districts in Nepal. In all we laid 696 quadrats each measuring 1 m x 1 m to understand the prevalence and distribution of P. polyphylla and held discussions in each district to collect information on the use, trade and conservation of P. polyphylla. We also reviewed over 150 studies pertaining to population and use of P. polyphylla, along with 18 years (2000-2017) of trade records of the species. We lastly modeled the species' potential distribution using a maximum entropy (MaxEnt) with 310 ground control points and 20 predictive variables. Results: In this study, we found P. polyphylla growing in all 51 districts, but were only able to find use records from 38 of these districts, and trade records from only 39 districts including 19 border districts. This pattern reveals that the production, collection, use and trade of P. polyphylla vary greatly across the country. Out model predicted a total of 51 mid-hill and mountainous districts as potential distribution areas of P. polyphylla, and this work shows that all of these districts except Surkhet and Mustang may be suitable for its growth in the future. We have found that the high demand for P. polyphylla has driven people to conduct har-vests prematurely resulting in habitat degradation. Illegal trade due to weak database management and porous border has also impacted the sustainability of these harvesting practices and made P. polyphylla vulnerable to extinction. To meet the need of market demand and to maintain sustainable production, P. polyphylla should be conserved and cultivated in forests and fringe areas respectively to the extent of its potential distribution and have more stringent sustainable harvesting guidelines applied to its trade.

However, rural communities also have priorities and needs that may not align with the goals of conservation and development projects. This makes effective engagement of communities by outside organizations an important challenge. When rural communities lose traditional livelihood options, they prioritize economic benefits as a condition for participating in projects, and they exhibit project fatigue when many projects are imposed on their time. We reflect on our experience in seeking to align the goals of a conservation and development project with community priorities in the Chico Mendes Extractive Reserve in Acre, Brazil. Our project featured capacity building for monitoring forest health to foster participation in payments for ecosystem services programs. Although we pursued prior consultations and designed participatory activities, and although we combined knowledge transmission with skills training, participation declined. That prompted our team to consult with community members, which generated important insights about expectations of immediate economic remuneration, community political cultures, communicative practices, and differences among local constituencies. These insights motivated adaptation of our practices via several strategies, such as focusing on young adults and holding workshops as part of community assemblies, which aligned project goals with the priorities of community members to improve project outcomes.","[Ribeiro, Sabina C.; Schmidt, Fernando A.] Univ Fed Acre, Ctr Ciencias Biol & Nat, Acre, Brazil; [Selaya, N.

However, there are still some species and biodiversity hotspots that are not included in the established reserve system. As such, the area is riddled with conservation gaps. Thus, we have adopted hotspot identification and gap analysis methodology in order to reasonably allocate resources for conservation of the key higher plant species in Northwest Yunnan. To begin, we comprehensively considered seven attributes to select 114 key species. Next, we obtained and superimposed the longitude and latitude coordinates of each species' location on a grid map with a 0.05 degrees x 0.05 degrees resolution. The ArcGIS10.2 software and R language were used to analyze species distribution; meanwhile hotspot identification and gap analysis were also performed in ArcGIS10.2. The results showed that: 1) there were 114 key higher plant species in Northwest Yunnan, which belong to 37 families and 68 genera; 2) the species distribution in Northwest Yunnan showed significant clustering and positive spatial correlation (Z = 2.90; P < 0.05), with the distribution relatively concentrated in Shangri-la and Gongshan counties; 3) approximately 60% of the hotspots were located in Gongshan, Deqin, and Shangri-la counties in the North; 4) the total priority conservation area was 5615 km(2), similar to 20.30% of which have been designated as nature reserves; and 5) a total of 13 conservation gaps were identified and put forward with targeted suggestions for expanding the conservation areas and building ecological corridors. The results of our study identified the priority conservation areas of key higher plant species in Northwest Yunnan, which aids in optimizing the existing conservation network system.

Large carnivores face high extinction risks, often exacerbated by the absence of adequate information on their ecological requirements, and the high economic and socio-political commitments that their conservation warrants. Country-scale conservation plans can serve as effective frameworks to prioritise areas, actions, and conservation investments. 2. We explore conservation tenets of retention, recovery, and restoration for the Endangered dholeCuon alpinusin India - a global stronghold for the species. Specifically, we: 1) examine the current status of dholes in India's states using a recent distribution assessment; 2) identify areas for directing management interventions - zones to be targeted for population recovery and for habitat recovery; 3) identify potential areas for range expansion; 4) use eco-socio-political criteria to determine state-wise conservation priority scores and likelihood of conservation action; and 5) conduct an exhaustive review of all published literature on dholes. 3. Dholes occupy similar to 49% of potential habitats in 685 of mainland India's 2342 sub-districts. We identified 143 sub-districts with potential for dhole population recovery, 145 for habitat recovery, and 404 for range expansion. Of the 34 mainland states/union territories, 17 were identified as high priority for dhole conservation. Of these, nine are adequately equipped to implement management actions to conserve dholes, while eight need to improve capacity towards increasing likelihood of conservation success. 4. Literature on dholes (from 1874 to 2019;n=237) was dominated by natural history notes, followed by distribution records and studies of population ecology. A majority of the reviewed studies were from India (55% of 215 country-specific papers). The number of studies showed an exponential increase over time: 43% were published in the last decade. 5. Our review of published literature revealed significant knowledge gaps in terms of quantitative ecological assessments across all dhole range-countries. Given this context, our results provide a comprehensive, multi-dimensional, and administratively feasible road map for dhole conservation in India, with potential applicability in other dhole range-countries and also for other threatened species.","[Srivathsa, Arjun; Oli, Madan K.] Univ Florida, Sch Nat Resources & Environm, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Srivathsa, Arjun; Oli, Madan K.] Univ Florida, Dept Wildlife Ecol & Conservat, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Srivathsa, Arjun; Sharma, Sushma] Wildlife Conservat Soc India, 551,7th Main Rd,2nd Phase, Bengaluru 560097, India; [Srivathsa, Arjun; Singh, Priya] TIFR, Natl Ctr Biol Sci, GKVK Campus, Bengaluru 560097, India; [Punjabi, Girish A.] Mafatlal Ctr, Wildlife Conservat Trust, 11th Floor, Mumbai 400021, Maharashtra, India",asrivathsa@ufl.edu; sushmasharma@wcsindia.org; karnisar@gmail.com; girisharjunpunjabi@gmail.com; olim@ufl.edu,68,4,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0305-1838,MAMMAL REV,Mammal Rev.,2020,,

Toxic weeds have been constantly spreading in recent decades; indeed, their occurrence is considered to provide an early sign of land degeneration. Policymakers and scientific researchers often focus on the negative effects of toxic weeds, such as how they inhibit forage growth, kill livestock, and cause economic losses. However, toxic weeds can have several potentially positive ecological impacts on grasslands, such as promoting soil and water conservation, improving nutrient cycling and biodiversity conservation, and protecting pastures from excessive damage by livestock. We reviewed the literature to detail the adaptive mechanisms underlying toxic weeds and to provide new insight into their roles in degraded grassland ecosystems. The findings highlight that the establishment of toxic weeds may provide a self-protective strategy of degenerated pastures that do not require special interventions. Consequently, policymakers, managers, and other personnel responsible for managing grasslands need to take appropriate actions to assess the long-term trade-offs between the development of animal husbandry and the maintenance of ecological services provided by grasslands.","[Zhang, Zhenchao; Sun, Jian; Liu, Miao; Xu, Ming; Wang, Yi; Ye, Chongchong] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Synth Res Ctr Chinese Ecosyst Res Network, Key Lab Ecosyst Network Observat & Modelling, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Zhenchao; Wu, Gao-lin] Northwest A&F Univ, Inst Soil & Water Conservat, State Key Lab Soil Eros & Dryland Farming Loess P, Yangling, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Sun, Jian; Zhou, Huakun] Chinese Acad Sci, Northwest Inst Plateau Biol, Qinghai Prov Key Lab Restorat Ecol Cold Area, Xining, Peoples R China; [Xu, Ming] Rutgers State Univ, Sch Environm & Biol Sci, Dept Ecol Evolut & Nat Resources, New Brunswick, NJ USA; [Tsechoe, Dorji] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Tibetan Plateau Res, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Wei, Tianxing] Beijing Forestry Univ, Sch Soil & Water Conservat, Beijing, Peoples R China",sunjian@igsnrr.ac.cn,112,6,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

Traditional ecological knowledge that the pastoral communities hold around their bio-physical environment has been a key to cope with stressors and adapt to the rapid socio-economic changes. We examined traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) on livestock and resource management, factors influencing livestock production and concurrent changes in an agro-pastoral system. We used mixed methods by conducting 44 semi-structured interviews, 10 key informants' interviews and resource mapping in five villages of Upper Spiti Landscape, western Himalaya. Our specific objectives were to (i) document TEK on livestock diet and management and (ii) understand the drivers and consequences of the change in the agro-pastoral society and associated traditional knowledge system. The herders of the study area possessed extensive knowledge of livestock diet and fodder species preference. They used this knowledge to optimize livestock grazing in pastures during summers and to fulfil the nutrient requirements of livestock species during stall feeding in winters. Seasonally, the aspect, altitude and accessibility of the pasture influenced the rotational use of pastures. In contrast, the quality of forage and water availability, distance of the pasture from village and threats from predators influenced the selection of grazing areas daily. There are evident changes in the livestock production system and signs that TEK is eroding in the region. Primary contributing factors to loss of TEK include changing aspirations of local people. These aspirations were related to employment in lucrative alternative options like cash crops and tourism, out-migration of the young generation for higher education and the arrival of immigrant labourers as new actors in livestock management. Livestock numbers in the study site remained dynamic between the year 2003-2016 owing to the substantive social and ecological changes. Our results suggest that while the traditional knowledge persists, the signs of erosion in traditional knowledge and associated changes in current herding practices are evident. We argue that recent changes in the pastoral social-ecological system, especially loss of TEK and non-traditional rearing practices, due to increasing dependence on immigrant labourers, may have negative implications for livestock production, rangeland health and wildlife conservation goals in the long run. Long term site-specific studies on livestock production and associated knowledge would be critical for adaptive rangeland management and policies.","[Singh, Rashmi; Babu, Suresh] Ambedkar Univ Delhi, Sch Human Ecol, New Delhi 110006, India; [Sharma, Rishi Kumar] Worldwide Fund Nat India, Lodhi Estate, New Delhi 110003, India; [Bhatnagar, Yash Veer] Nat Conservat Fdn, Mysuru 570017, Karnataka, India",rashmi89singh@gmail.com,78,3,3,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",2041-7136,PASTORALISM,Pastoralism,2020,gold,

Such data are particularly important for species affected by habitat fragmentation such as Magnolia cubensis subsp. acunae, a Critically Endangered magnolia subspecies endemic to Cuba. Using genetic data from 67 individuals, we aimed to evaluate the effect of habitat fragmentation on two subpopulations in the Guamuhaya mountain range, in Topes de Collantes Protected Natural Landscape and Lomas de Banao Ecological Reserve. We characterize the structure and genetic diversity of these subpopulations, with the objective of managing their conservation more effectively. We used Landsat satellite images to determine land-cover types at the two locations and calculated indices of habitat fragmentation. For genetic analyses, we extracted DNA from the leaf tissue of individuals from the two subpopulations and used EL microsatellite markers to genotype them. We calculated heterozygosity, allelic richness and the F-statistics, to evaluate genetic variability. The montane rainforest in Topes de Collantes was most affected by habitat fragmentation, with smaller patches of more irregular shapes, compared to submontane forest at this location and both montane and submontane forests in Lomas de Banao. Genetic diversity was higher in Topes de Collantes, but we found no genetic differentiation between subpopulations. Our findings suggest the two subpopulations can be considered a single evolutionary unit and conservation entity.

This requires the mobilization of their experiences and site-specific knowledge, which is not only factual knowledge, but deeply connected to individual values, attitudes and practices adapted to local contexts. Although the objectives, attitudes, and motivations of private forest owners (PFO) have been analyzed extensively, few studies focus on how biodiversity conservation can be integrated into their forests. To gain a comprehensive understanding of the interrelation between conservation practices, perceptions, and locally held forest knowledge, we conducted a survey of PFOs in southwestern Germany. Using a logistic regression analysis, we sought to identify predictors of respondents' conservation practices, defined by the retention of deadwood and non-use of forest areas. Perceptions about positive conservation impacts increased the likelihood of implementing conservation practices, while forest-related variables such as property size and frequency of timber harvest had no significant effect. Our results show that PFOs' perceptions of biodiversity conservation affect their management approaches, which can provide ecologically valuable stepping-stones for conserving biodiversity on a landscape-scale. This may complement officially protected forest areas and formal conservation programs. Forest policy needs to consider that forest ownership entails not only economic values, but others such as identity, family heritage and personal responsibility for conserving natural resources.

Here, we use a guild of select mammalian carnivores (wild canids and hyenas) in India to (i) generate distribution maps at the spatial scale of administrative sub-districts, that are relevant to management, (ii) examine ecological, social and biogeographic factors associated with their distribution, assess key threats, and identify areas important for their conservation, (iii) use prioritization tools for balancing habitat conservation, human needs and economic growth, and (iv) evaluate the spatial congruence between areas with high conservation potential, and areas currently in focus for protection efforts, conservation investments, and infrastructure development. We find that the current Protected Area system does not adequately cover or represent diverse habitats, that there is immense potential for States to increase financial investments towards alternative conservation strategies, and, most infrastructure projects may be potentially jeopardizing important carnivore habitats where the two overlap. Our framework allowed for identifying locations where conservation investments would lead to the highest benefits for carnivores as flagships, which also benefit other species across habitats. We make a case for re-evaluating how large-scale prioritization assessments are made, and for broadening the purview of conservation policies in India and other developing countries.","[Srivathsa, Arjun] Univ Florida, Sch Nat Resources & Environm, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Srivathsa, Arjun] Univ Florida, Dept Wildlife Ecol & Conservat, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Srivathsa, Arjun; Sharma, Sushma] Wildlife Conservat Soc India, Bengaluru, India; [Majgaonkar, Iravatee; Banerjee, Aditya] Ashoka Trust Res Ecol & Environm, Bengaluru, India; [Singh, Priya] Natl Ctr Biol Sci, Researchers Wildlife Conservat, Bengaluru, India; [Punjabi, Girish Arjun] Wildlife Conservat Trust, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India; [Chawla, Malaika Mathew] James Cook Univ, Coll Sci & Engn, Townsville, Qld, Australia",asrivathsa@wcsindia.org,69,7,8,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"TEMPLE CIRCUS, TEMPLE WAY, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1748-9326,ENVIRON RES LETT,Environ.

But many are valued for their passive usefulness, i.e., their mere existence contributes to supporting, regulating or cultural environmental services that support human well-being. Hence, there is inherent social value to conserving such species as natural assets. However, such species are seldom priced as natural assets, and thus not accounted for in sustainability wealth measures because deriving non-market prices is challenging. We overcome this limitation by presenting a new approach for natural asset pricing of species with passive value that can be incorporated into national sustainability wealth accounting. We explicitly consider the relationship between prevailing institutions, species interactions, and ecosystem dynamics. Our approach is illustrated with the case of threatened woodland caribou in the Alberta Oil Sands. We show that conservation can be considered an investment while destructive activities can lead to a loss or conservation debt; and forgoing destructive activities can be considered a capital gain, increasing future wealth. Our approach reveals that caribou conservation in Alberta is leading to a conservation debt on the order of CA$800 million.","[Maher, Samantha M.; Fenichel, Eli P.; Schmitz, Oswald J.] Yale Univ, Sch Forestry & Environm Studies, New Haven, CT 06511 USA; [Maher, Samantha M.] EcoHlth Alliance, 460 W 34th Floor 17, New York, NY 10001 USA; [Adamowicz, Wiktor L.] Univ Alberta, Resource Econ & Environm Sociol, 515 Gen Serv Bldg, Edmonton, AB T6G 2H1, Canada",maher@ecohealthalliance.org,72,4,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1051-0761,ECOL APPL,Ecol.

The lesser prairie-chicken (Tympanuchus pallidicinctus) is a grouse species of conservation concern native to the southwestern Great Plains of the United States. Recent lesser prairie-chicken conservation planning has involved identifying ecologically important areas but has not incorporated economic data into prioritization of areas to target for conservation management. Objectives We used the program Marxan to develop a decision-support tool for managers in Kansas to prioritize tracts for improving lesser prairie-chicken habitat quality and increasing habitat availability. We developed three different conservation scenarios and evaluated the tradeoffs among multiple planning objectives in these scenarios. Methods We incorporated population targets from an existing conservation plan and agricultural economic data to help select land with maximum ecological value and minimum economic productivity to prioritize for lesser prairie-chicken conservation. We compared potential conservation plans and incorporated a post hoc connectivity model to test potential for individuals to travel among habitat patches in these plans during dispersal events. Results We found that different conservation scenarios led to different solutions, though differences varied by ecoregion. Potential solutions for all scenarios contained habitat patches not currently included in existing conservation plans and had high connectivity potential. Conclusions These results provide context for spatial prioritization of lesser prairie-chicken habitat management in Kansas. Application of this approach to species of conservation interest could help managers incorporate socioeconomic factors into planning methods and identify important tracts for conservation currently overlooked by existing planning methods.","[Schindler, Alexander R.] Clemson Univ, Dept Forestry & Environm Conservat, Clemson, SC USA; [Haukos, David A.] Kansas State Univ, US Geol Survey, Kansas Cooperat Fish & Wildlife Res Unit, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA; [Hagen, Christian A.] Oregon State Univ, Dept Fisheries & Wildlife, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Ross, Beth E.] Clemson Univ, US Geol Survey, South Carolina Cooperat Fish & Wildlife Res Unit, Clemson, SC 29634 USA",bross5@clemson.edu,52,2,2,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-2973,LANDSCAPE ECOL,Landsc.

These data are timely given the Congolese government recently announced its intention to create a marine conservation zone to protect marine turtles in Loango Bay.

For this, however, information is needed on life history and ecological traits, which is lacking in many taxa, including threatened species. Species recently described or recognized as valid are of particular concern, due to the shortage of even basic knowledge. A case in point is the recently recognized and Near Threatened dolphin freshwater mussel Unio delphinus Spengler, 1793, which is endemic to the western Iberian Peninsula and has suffered marked population declines. To overcome information gaps for U. delphinus, we carried out a holistic biological study across the species range, aiming to: i) estimate the area of occupancy (AOO) and extent of occurrence (EOO) based on updated distribution data taken from the literature and recent surveys; ii) estimate growth patterns from biometrical (shell dimensions and growth annuli) measurements taken on specimens from seven populations; iii) estimate sex ratios from gonad tissue biopsies collected on specimens from eight populations; iv) estimate gametogenesis and sex ratio through histological examination of gonad and gill tissues collected monthly for a year, from a single population; and v) determine host species from infestation trials of glochidia with co-occurring fish species. We estimated an EOO of 706 km(2) and an AOO of 61 km(2), which together with data on declines assigns the species to the Endangered category using IUCN criteria. Unio delphinus was found to grow faster and to be shorter-lived (up to 11 years, maturity at around 2 years old) than other European freshwater mussels. Growth and life span are similar across the range in lotic habitats, but different from that in lentic habitats. The larvae of U. delphinus may attach to most co-occurring fish species, but only native species were effective hosts. Native cyprinids, especially those from the genus Squalius, seem to be the primary hosts. Overall, the information provided contributes to a better conservation status assessment, selection of conservation and rehabilitation areas, guidance for the establishment of propagation programs and better timing for specimens' manipulation including monitoring and possible translocations. The framework presented here highlights the importance of basic biological studies to define good ecological and physiological status.","[Lopes-Lima, Manuel; Goncalves, Duarte V.; Beja, Pedro] Univ Porto, CIBIO InBIO Res Ctr Biodivers & Genet Resources, Campus Agr Vairao, P-4485661 Vairao, Portugal; [Lopes-Lima, Manuel; Hinzmann, Mariana; Froufe, Elsa; Moreira, Claudia; Araujo, Sandra; Goncalves, Duarte V.] CIIMAR CIMAR Interdisciplinary Ctr Marine & Envir, Terminal Cruzeiros Porto Leixoes, Av Gen Norton de Matos S-N, P-4450208 Matosinhos, Portugal; [Lopes-Lima, Manuel] IUCN, IUCN SSC Mollusc Specialist Grp, David Attenborough Bldg,Pembroke St, Cambridge, England; [Varandas, Simone] Univ Tras Os Montes & Alto Douro, CITAB UTAD Ctr Res & Technol Agroenvironm & Biol, Forestry Dept, Apartado 1013, P-5001811 Vila Real, Portugal; [Reis, Joaquim] Univ Lisboa Campo Grande, Fac Ciencias, MARE Marine & Environm Sci Ctr, P-1749016 Lisbon, Portugal; [Moreira, Claudia] UP, ICBAS, Rua Jorge Viterbo Ferreira 228, P-4050313 Porto, Portugal; [Miranda, Fernando; Teixeira, Amilcar] Polytech Inst Braganca, Sch Agr, CIMO ESA IPB Mt Res Ctr, Campus Santa Apolonia,Apartado 1172, P-5301854 Braganca, Portugal; [Beja, Pedro] Univ Lisbon, Inst Super Agron, CIBIO InBIO Res Ctr Biodivers & Genet Resources, P-1349017 Lisbon, Portugal; [Sousa, Ronaldo] Univ Minho, Dept Biol, CBMA Ctr Mol & Environm Biol, Campus Gualtar, P-4710057 Braga, Portugal",manuelpmlopeslima@gmail.com,69,9,9,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1470-160X,ECOL INDIC,Ecol.

These species are illustrative of efforts to move beyond single-species conservation because they facilitate hundreds of plants and animals worldwide. This review is intended to place aspen in a global conservation context by focusing on the many scientific advances taking place in such biologically diverse systems. In this manner, aspen may serve as a model for other widespread keystone systems where science-based practice may have world implications for biodiversity conservation. In many regions, aspen can maintain canopy dominance for decades to centuries as the sole major broadleaf trees in forested landscapes otherwise dominated by conifers. Aspen ecosystems are valued for many reasons, but here we highlight their potential as key contributors to regional and global biodiversity. We present global trends in research priorities, strengths, and weaknesses based on, 1) a qualitative survey, 2) a systematic literature analysis, and 3) regional syntheses of leading research topics. These regional syntheses explore important aspen uses, threats, and research priorities with the ultimate intent of research sharing focused on sound conservation practice. In all regions, we found that aspen enhance biodiversity, facilitate rapid (re)colonization in natural and damaged settings (e.g., abandoned mines), and provide adaptability in changing environments. Common threats to aspen ecosystems in many, but not all, regions include effects of herbivory, land clearing, logging practices favoring conifer species, and projected climate warming. We also highlight regional research gaps that emerged from the three survey approaches above. We believe multi-scale research is needed that examines disturbance processes in the context of dynamic climates where ecological, physiological, and genetic variability will ultimately determine widespread aspen sustainability. Based on this global review of aspen research, we argue for the advancement of the mega-conservation strategy, centered on the idea of sustaining a set of common keystone communities (aspen) that support wide arrays of obligate species. This approach contrasts with conventional preservation which focuses limited resources on individual species residing in narrow niches. (C) 2019 The Authors.

Using a case study from Hawai'i, we examined if forest restoration aimed at reviving and maintaining cultural interactions with the forest is compatible with other priority conservation metrics. We identified species of high biocultural value for an Indigenous (Native Hawaiian) community, and then tested if these species also have high conservation value in terms of their biogeographic origin, ability to support native wildlife, and ability to persist independently within the restored context. Additionally, we tested if an assemblage of species with high biocultural value can also support high functional trait diversity. We found bioculturally important species to have high conservation values for all metrics tested, except for the ability to conserve rare or endangered endemic species. However, a broader application of biocultural conservation, such as the revival of the sacred forest concept, can address this priority as part of a mosaic of different species assemblages and levels of access. We also found that biocultural value may, at least in part, be a function of coevolutionary time: the length of time over which a community has interacted with a given species. Given that forests are invaluable to many Indigenous communities and, given the existential threats many of these communities currently face, we suggest that forests containing species assemblages of high biocultural value, such as those in Hawai?i, be considered as critical cultural habitat.","[Winter, Kawika B.; Quazi, Shimona A.] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Natl Trop Bot Garden, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Winter, Kawika B.] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Hawaii Inst Marine Biol, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Winter, Kawika B.] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Nat Resources & Environm Management, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Winter, Kawika B.] Hawaii Conservat Alliance, Honolulu, HI 96848 USA; [Ticktin, Tamara; Quazi, Shimona A.] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Bot, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA",,70,13,13,RESILIENCE ALLIANCE,WOLFVILLE,"ACADIA UNIV, BIOLOGY DEPT, WOLFVILLE, NS B0P 1X0, CANADA",1708-3087,ECOL SOC,Ecol.

In Brazil, the restoration goal for 2030 is 12 million hectares. Despite the great demand for ecological restoration across the whole of Brazil, there have been no analyses of the studies carried out in different biomes. In addition, conservation efforts must cover all biomes, so that different regions can take advantage of the many benefits of restoration. Our aim was to identify advances and gaps in current restoration knowledge in order to guide future efforts in Brazil. Our bibliometric survey in the Web of Science using 23 keywords related to restoration generated a total of 530 papers, of which 291 were included in the analysis. The papers were published in 121 scientific journals between 1988 and 2018, with the largest number of papers in 2016. The Atlantic Forest was the biome with the highest number of studies, as it is one of the most threatened tropical forest regions in the world and maintains the largest number of research institutions and receives the highest level of funding support in the country. Regarding the types of studies, temporal monitoring was more frequent in the Amazon, Cerrado, Castings, and Pampa, while the monitoring at one point in time was more frequent in the Atlantic Forest. From the studies examined, 31% used a reference area for comparing restoration success. The most studied organisms were plants (81%), and among them, trees were the most frequent, followed by fungi, birds, invertebrates, mammals, and reptiles. The pre-restoration degradation differed among biomes, with deforestation for logging the most cited in the Amazon, agriculture, and livestock in the Atlantic Forest and Cerrado, logging and cattle ranching in Caatinga, and livestock in the Pampa and Pantanal. In general, active/assisted natural succession was the most frequent restoration process: planting seedlings more readily occurred in the Amazon, Atlantic Forest, and Caatinga, whereas natural regeneration in the Cerrado and Pantanal and sowing in Pampa. The studies varied among the age of restoration ( > 1 to 67 years for active restoration and > 1 to 120 years for passive/unassisted natural succession), and the number of species planted (1 to 121 species). We identified an important regional knowledge gap for the Pantanal, Caatinga, and Pampa, as well as the need to include reference areas, evaluate different restoration techniques (besides planting seedlings), and the inclusion of other taxa and life forms in biodiversity studies apart from trees. We also identified the need to expand research to assess landscape metrics, prioritization, legislation, and public policies.","[Guerra, Angelica; Reis, Leticia Koutchin; Gomes Borges, Felipe Luis; Garcia, Leticia Couto] Univ Fed Mato Grosso do Sul, Inst Biociencias, LEI, Ave Costa e Silva S-N, BR-79070900 Campo Grande, MS, Brazil; [Reis, Leticia Koutchin; Manrique Pineda, Daniel Armando; Miranda, Camila Oliveira; Furtado de Lima Maidana, Debora Porfiria] Univ Fed Mato Grosso do Sul, Inst Biociencias, Programa Posgrad Biol Vegetal, Ave Costa e Silva S-N, BR-79070900 Campo Grande, MS, Brazil; [Guerra, Angelica; Gomes Borges, Felipe Luis; Alves Ojeda, Paula Thais; Rocha dos Santos, Thiago Mateus; Shibuya, Patricia Sayuri] Univ Fed Mato Grosso do Sul, Inst Biociencias, Programa Posgrad Ecol & Conservacao, Ave Costa e Silva S-N, BR-79070900 Campo Grande, MS, Brazil; [Marques, Marcia C.

This paper investigates factors affecting citizens' perceptions of China's eco-labeling system for elephant ivory, which was established in 2004, using unique datasets collected in 2015 and 2017. The results indicate that citizens in China have little understanding of the ivory-labeling system. <10% of the participants were aware of the three accreditation subsystems for ivory products regulating manufacturers, retailers, and the products and only about 20% were familiar with one subsystem. The results of Bayesian logit models show that citizens' demographic and other characteristics are significantly correlated with their knowledge of the labeling system for elephant ivory, and the effects varied for the 2015 and 2017 samples. The one consistent influence was income level, which had similar significant and positive impacts in all of the models. The temporal coefficients reflecting changes in awareness between 2015 and 2017 were not significant, indicating that knowledge of the ivory-labeling system did not increase overall during that period. Our results indicate that significantly greater outreach is needed for China's ivory-labeling system so citizens can consistently play a role in ridding the market of illegal ivory products and regulating noncommercial ivory trading. Special attention should be given to groups of citizens who have relatively little education, income, and awareness of wild-life conservation efforts. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

We investigated relationships between the social system structure of coastal communities alongside biological data describing the status and trends in fish communities around Yap, Micronesia. Traditional marine tenure made Yap an ideal place to investigate the underlying principles of social-ecological systems, as communities own and manage spatially-defined coastal resources. Analysis of social survey data revealed three social regimes, which were linked to corresponding gradients of ecological outcomes. Communities with decentralized decision-making and a preference for communal forms of fishing had the greatest ecological outcomes, while communities lacking any form of leadership were linked to poor ecological outcomes. Interestingly, communities with strong top-down leadership were shown to have variable ecological outcomes, depending on the presence of key groups or individuals. We last investigated whether social perception could successfully predict the status of fish assemblages within non-managed reefs. Several biological metrics of fish assemblages within non-managed areas were significantly predicted by a gradient of human access, suggesting social perception could not predict the growing human footprint over the study period. These findings highlight the potentially overlooked role that community-oriented decision-making structures and fishing methods could play in successful conservation efforts, and the limitations of perception data. Policies that promote communal marine resource use offer a novel approach to improve fisheries management and promote social-ecological resilience.","[Johnson, Steven M.; McLean, Matthew; Houk, Peter] Univ Guam, UoG Stn, Marine Lab, Mangilao, GU 96923 USA; [Reyuw, Bertha M.; Yalon, Anthony] Yap Conservat Act Program, Yap 96943, FM, Micronesia; [Johnson, Steven M.] Oregon State Univ, Coll Earth Ocean & Atmospher Sci, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Reyuw, Bertha M.] Sophia Univ, Grad Sch Global Environm Studies, Tokyo 1028554, Japan; [McLean, Matthew] Dalhousie Univ, Dept Biol, Halifax, NS B3H 4R2, Canada",johnstev@oregonstate.ed,49,3,3,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0006-3207,BIOL CONSERV,Biol.

Forests allocated to conservation, production and community management are expected to have different conservation values. Here, we aimed to identify the determinants of the conservation value of tropical forests in southeastern Cameroon, by disentangling the effects of forest allocations, proximity to human settlements, and local habitat. We inventoried two taxonomical groups: mammal species with camera traps (3464 independent detection events) and dung beetle species with pitfall traps (4475 individuals). We used an integrated analytical approach, examining both species richness and composition. For both mammals and dung beetles, species richness decreased from the protected area to the community forests, and the logging concession showed intermediate richness. Species richness of both groups was negatively correlated to the proximity to human settlements and disturbance, with a decreasing gradient of body mass and the loss of the most threatened species. The replacement (i.e., spatial turnover) of both mammal and dung beetle species among forest allocations suggest an integration of conservation initiatives to a large number of different sites, with a priority on protected and remote areas of high biodiversity. These results confirm the high conservation value of protected areas and their essential role in conservation strategies, ecologically connected with well-managed production forests with variable conservation value mainly depending on accessibility. Community forests located close to villages are much more degraded but not totally defaunated and still provide bushmeat to local populations.","[Lhoest, Simon; Fonteyn, Davy; Dainou, Kasso; Delbeke, Laetitia; Doucet, Jean-Louis; Dufrene, Marc; Ligot, Gauthier; Verheggen, Francois; Vermeulen, Cedric; Fayolle, Adeline] Univ Liege, Gembloux Agrobio Tech, Passage Deportes 25, B-5030 Gembloux, Belgium; [Dainou, Kasso] Nat Asbl, Rue Prov 62, B-1301 Wavre, Belgium; [Josso, Jean-Francois] Assoc Catharsius, Rue Baudoin 10, F-75013 Paris, France; [Oszwald, Johan; Rivault, Erwan] Univ Rennes, Dept Geog Planning, UFR Social Sci, Pl Recteur Henri Le Moal CS 24307, F-35043 Rennes, France; [Biwole, Achille] Univ Douala, Higher Sch Teaching Tech, BP 1872, Douala, Cameroon",simon.lhoest@uliege.be,93,17,17,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0006-3207,BIOL CONSERV,Biol.

I ask how a traditional policy view on conservation was handled during this change, and what role EU funding has in preserving or changing a traditional management policy for landscape conservation. The conclusions are that landscape protection is driven by political and ideological values connected with institutionalized aesthetic components that are adjusted to whatever disciplinary focus prevails at the time. However, traditional approaches are retained, excluding participatory methods and the social dimensions on landscape management.

We tested the hypothesis that major geographic features have produced a concordant genetic structure in phylogenetically independent lineages. A rigorous bibliographic search was performed, selecting available molecular information from six taxa occupying distinct southern biomes of South America: Yungas, Prepuna, Puna and northern Monte. We estimated within-population genetic diversity, the genetic structure and haplotype phylogenies to assemble distribution maps of genetic barriers for each species. We found a strong association between genetic variation and latitudinal distribution of populations. We detected a major barrier for six taxa at 27 degrees S latitude and a second one for a group of three species at 25-26 degrees S. Two alternative non-exclusive hypotheses - geology and/or climate - explain concordant genetic barriers in divergent lineages. We suggest that the term 'biogeographically significant units' portrays a group of populations of phylogenetically unrelated taxa that inhabit the same geographic region that have been similarly impacted by major physical events, which can be used to identify priority areas in landscape conservation.","[Paula Quiroga, M.; Castello, Lucia; Quipildor, Vilma; Premoli, Andrea C.] Ctr Reg Univ Bariloche UNComahue, CONICET, Lab Ecot INIBIOMA, Quintra 1250, RA-8400 San Carlos De Bariloche, Rio Negro, Argentina; [Castello, Lucia] Univ Natl Cordoba, Inst Multidisciplinario Biol Vegetal IMBIV, CONICET, Velez Sarsfield 1611, RA-5000 Cordoba, Argentina; [Quipildor, Vilma] Univ Natl Salta, Lab Invest Bot LABIBO, Fac Ciencias Nat, CONICET, Av Bolivia 5150, RA-4400 Salta, Argentina",emepequ@gmail.com,67,3,3,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0376-8929,ENVIRON CONSERV,Environ.

Setting an ambitious recovery target for a species requires considering the size, density, and demographic structure of its populations such that they fulfill the interactions, roles, and functions of the species in the ecosystems in which they are embedded. A recently proposed framework for an International Union for Conservation of Nature Green List of Species formalizes this requirement by defining a fully recovered species in terms of representation, viability, and functionality. Defining and quantifying ecological function from the viewpoint of species recovery is challenging in concept and application, but also an opportunity to insert ecological theory into conservation practice. We propose 2 complementary approaches to assessing a species' ecological functions: confirmation (listing interactions of the species, identifying ecological processes and other species involved in these interactions, and quantifying the extent to which the species contributes to the identified ecological process) and elimination (inferring functionality by ruling out symptoms of reduced functionality, analogous to the red-list approach that focuses on symptoms of reduced viability). Despite the challenges, incorporation of functionality into species recovery planning is possible in most cases and it is essential to a conservation vision that goes beyond preventing extinctions and aims to restore a species to levels beyond what is required for its viability. This vision focuses on conservation and recovery at the species level and sees species as embedded in ecosystems, influencing and being influenced by the processes in those ecosystems. Thus, it connects and integrates conservation at the species and ecosystem levels.","[Akcakaya, H. Resit] SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Ecol & Evolut, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA; [Akcakaya, H.

We found different drivers appeared important at each ecological scale and studying any of the three scales alone would give a biased understanding of the process driving the system. Island biogeography (resource limitation) was most important for carnivore richness, with higher richness on larger islands and lower richness as distance from the mainland increased. Marten presence on individual islands appeared to be driven by island size (resource limitation) and human avoidance (competitive interaction). Marten abundance at camera trap sites was driven by the cascading effect of coyotes (Canis latrans) on fishers (Pekania pennanti) (competitive interaction). Incorporating three ecological scales gave novel insights into the varying effects of resource limitation and competitive interaction processes.

We analysed to what extent and how ecological scientists gave input to policy for two approaches advocated for promoting forest biodiversity in production forests in Sweden: green-tree retention (GTR) and continuous-cover forestry (CCF). GTR was introduced into forest policy in the 1970s and became widely implemented in the 1990s. Ecological scientists took part in the policy process by providing expert opinions, educational activities and as lobbyists, long before research confirming the positive effects of GTR on biodiversity was produced. In contrast, CCF was essentially banned in forest legislation in 1979. In the 1990s, policy implicitly opened up for CCF implementation, but CCF still remains largely a rare silvicultural outlier. Scientific publications addressing CCF appeared earlier than GTR studies, but with less focus on the effects on biodiversity. Ecological scientists promoted CCF in certain areas, but knowledge from other disciplines and other socio-political factors appear to have been more important than ecological arguments in the case of CCF. The wide uptake of GTR was enhanced by its consistency with the silvicultural knowledge and normative values that forest managers had adopted for almost a century, whereas CCF challenged those ideas. Public pressure and institutional requirements were also key to GTR implementation but were not in place for CCF. Thus, scientific ecological knowledge may play an important role for policy uptake and development, but knowledge from other research disciplines and socio-political factors are also important.","[Stens, Anna] Umea Univ, Dept Hist Philosoph & Religious Studies, S-90187 Umea, Sweden; [Roberge, Jean-Michel] Swedish Forest Agcy, Forest Unit, Box 284, S-90106 Umea, Sweden; [Roberge, Jean-Michel] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Wildlife Fish & Environm Studies, S-90183 Umea, Sweden; [Lofmarck, Erik] Orebro Univ, Environm Sociol Sect, S-70182 Orebro, Sweden; [Lindahl, Karin Beland] Lulea Univ Technol, Dept Business Adm Technol & Social Sci, S-97187 Lulea, Sweden; [Felton, Adam; Nilsson, Urban] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Southern Swedish Forest Res Ctr, Box 49, S-23053 Alnarp, Sweden; [Widmark, Camilla] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Forest Econ, S-90183 Umea, Sweden; [Rist, Lucy; Laudon, Hjalmar] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Forest Ecol & Management, S-90183 Umea, Sweden; [Johansson, Johanna] Sodertorn Univ, Sch Nat Sci Technol & Environm Studies, S-14189 Huddinge, Sweden; [Nordin, Annika] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Forest Genet & Plant Physiol, S-90183 Umea, Sweden; [Ranius, Thomas] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Ecol, Box 7044, S-75007 Uppsala, Sweden",anna.stens@umu.se; jean-michel.roberge@skogsstyrelsen.se; erik.lofmarck@oru.se; karin.beland.lindahl@ltu.se; adam.felton@slu.se; camilla.widmark@slu.se; lucyrist@gmail.com; johanna.johansson@sh.se; annika.nordin@slu.se; urban.nilsson@slu.se; hjalmar.laudon@slu.se; thomas.ranius@slu.se,98,2,2,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0960-3115,BIODIVERS CONSERV,Biodivers.

However, most assessments of the value of modified habitats rely heavily on species presence and/or abundance, masking ecological processes such as habitat selection and phenomena like ecological traps, which may render species persistence uncertain. High species richness has been documented in tropical agroforestry systems, but comparisons with native habitat remnants generally lack detailed information on species demography and habitat use. We generated a multi-species, multi-measure framework to evaluate the role of habitat selection in the adaptation of species to transformed landscapes, and demonstrate that its use could affect how we value the contribution different land uses make to biodiversity conservation. We analysed 7 years of capture-mark-recapture and observation data for twelve species of resident birds present in native forest remnants and shade coffee plantations in a mega-diverse region. We assessed whether species behaved adaptively by evaluating the correlation between measures of habitat preference (occurrence, abundance, fidelity, inter-seasonal variance and age) and performance (body condition, muscle, primary moult, breeding and juveniles) in forest and coffee, and generated hypotheses about their role in species persistence. We documented adaptive habitat selection for seven species, non-ideal selection for four and maladaptive selection for one. While many species showed equal preference and/or equal performance in many traits, in general we found more evidence for birds preferring and/or performing better in forest than coffee, although relationships between our indicators and population adaptation need to be studied further before our proposed framework can be applied to more species and landscapes. While shade coffee can act as a biodiversity-friendly matrix providing complementary or supplementary habitat to a wide range of resident bird species, protecting remnants of native vegetation is still of paramount importance for biodiversity conservation in agricultural landscapes.","[Maria Sanchez-Clavijo, Lina; Francisco Quintana-Ascencio, Pedro] Univ Cent Florida, Dept Biol, Orlando, FL 32816 USA; [Maria Sanchez-Clavijo, Lina] Inst Invest Recursos Biol Alexander von Humboldt, Bogota, Colombia; [James Bayly, Nicholas] SELVA Res Conservat Neotrop, Bogota, Colombia",sanchezc.linam@gmail.com,83,8,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8790,J ANIM ECOL,J.

Improving the flow of information between conservation researchers, practitioners and policy-makers could lead to dramatic gains in the effectiveness of conservation practice. However, several barriers can hinder this transfer including lack of time, inaccessibility of evidence, the real or perceived irrelevance of scientific research to practical questions, and the politically motivated spread of disinformation. Conservation Evidence works to overcome these barriers by providing a freely-available database of summarized scientific evidence for the effects of conservation interventions on biodiversity. The methods used to build this database - a combination of discipline-wide literature searching and subject-wide evidence synthesis - have been developed over the last 15 years to address the challenges of synthesizing large volumes of evidence of varying quality and measured outcomes. Here, we describe the methods to enhance understanding of the database and how it should be used.

Advanced decision support tools would facilitate identifying practical solutions. We examined how to achieve compromise across competing objectives in conservation translocations via an examination of giant tortoises in the Galapagos Islands with ancestry from the extinct Floreana Island species (Chelonoidis niger). Efforts have begun to populate Floreana Island with tortoises genetically similar to its historical inhabitants while balancing three potentially competing objectives - restoring ecosystem services (sustaining a high tortoise population size), maximizing genome representation of the extinct C. niger species and maintaining a genetically diverse population - under realistic cost constraints. We developed a novel approach to this conservation decision problem by coupling an individual-based simulation model with generalized additive models and global optimization. We identified several incompatibilities among programme objectives, with quasi-optimal single-objective solutions (sets of management actions) differing substantially in programme duration, translocation age, incubation temperature (determinant of sex ratio) and the number of individuals directly translocated from the source population. Quasi-optimal single-objective solutions were able to produce outcomes (i.e. population size and measures of genetic diversity and C. niger genome representation) to within 75% of their highest simulated outcomes (e.g. highest population size achieved across all simulations) within a cost constraint of c. $2m USD, but these solutions resulted in severe declines (up to 74% reduction) in outcomes for non-focal objectives. However, when all programme objectives were equally weighted to produce a multi-objective solution, all objectives were met to within 90% of the highest achievable mean values across all cost constraints. Synthesis and applications. Multi-objective conservation translocations are likely to encounter complex trade-offs and conflicts among programme objectives. Here, we developed a novel combination of modelling approaches to identify optimal management strategies. We found that solutions that simultaneously addressed multiple, competing objectives performed better than single-objective solutions. Our model-based decision support tool demonstrates that timely, cost-effective solutions can be identified in cases where management objectives appear to be incompatible.","[Hunter, Elizabeth A.] Georgia Southern Univ, Dept Biol, Statesboro, GA 30458 USA; [Gibbs, James P.] SUNY Syracuse, Coll Environm Sci & Forestry, Dept Environm & Forest Biol, Syracuse, NY 13210 USA; [Cayot, Linda J.; Tapia, Washington] Galapagos Conservancy, Fairfax, VA USA; [Quinzin, Maud C.; Miller, Joshua M.; Caccone, Adalgisa] Yale Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, New Haven, CT USA; [Shoemaker, Kevin T.] Univ Nevada, Dept Nat Resources & Environm Sci, Reno, NV 89557 USA",elizabethhunter@georgiasouthern.edu,54,2,2,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8901,J APPL ECOL,J.

Their share is about 1% of the flora of vascular plants of Siberia. For the first time, according to floristic zoning, the composition of the chorological groups of the stenoendemics of Siberia has been established. The zones of concentration of their ranges are determined. The largest number of species studied (23) is concentrated in the Altai-Siberian ecoregion. A significant number of stenoendemic species is also represented in the Baikal-Siberian (10) and West Siberian (8) regions. It has been quantitatively proven that the most favorable conditions for the existence of stenoendemics are in Southern Siberia. The mountain systems of Altai and Sayan provide the most diverse spectra of habitats for the successful implementation of microevolutionary processes, as well as the level of isolation sufficient to isolate new species. For the determination of the environmental conditions conducive to the speciation processes, the grouping of the studied species according to their belonging to floristic complexes is carried out. More than a third of the studied species of the Altai-Siberian ecoregion (9 out of 23) are confined to the high-mountain floristic complex. Stenoendemics of the forest floristic complex are concentrated in the Altai-Siberian and West Siberian ecoregions and form a grouping comparable in value to the high-mountain floristic complex types. In the Baikal-Siberian, species of the steppe floristic complex predominate, which is due to the diversity of the steppe areas and their insular character. It has been established that the level of state protection of the studied species is unacceptably low, since none of them are listed in the Red Data Book of the Russian Federation. To assess the degree of study and the prospects for further research on endemic species, a methodology for their ranking by quantitative indicators has been developed and tested. The recommendations presented in the article should be the basis for the consideration of questions regarding the inclusion of the studied endemic species of vascular plants of Siberia into the lists of rare and endangered plants of the Russian Federation.","[Baikov, K.

This approach could be especially valuable for the conservation of farm ponds, which are abundant and serve key agricultural functions on private lands. Though farm ponds also provide wildlife habitat, little is known about how they are managed or how values and beliefs of their owners relate to their quality. To address this knowledge gap, we collected data on pond habitat quality and management using historical aerial imagery and high-resolution Google Earth satellite imagery of the Grand River Grasslands of southern Iowa and Northern Missouri. We also collected spatially congruent social data using a mail back survey sent to 456 landowners in the region (32.7% response rate). We used mixed-effects linear regression to link indicators of habitat quality to the survey results. We found that many ponds were permanent, accessible to cattle, in early successional states, and had little wetland vegetation, indicating a scarcity of suitable habitat for wildlife. At the same time, 35-57% of survey respondents said they would be willing to change their management to benefit aquatic organisms. Our analyses indicated that higher cover of cattails correlated with ownership by respondents who regarded row crops or income from agriculture as less important and ponds tended to be temporary if owned by respondents who had many ponds. Moving forward, large landowners and those willing to manage their land to benefit wildlife may constitute a core set of future partners for conservation efforts focused on improving pond habitat in the region.","[Swartz, Timothy M.] Temple Univ, Dept Biol, Ctr Biodivers, Philadelphia, PA 19140 USA; [Swartz, Timothy M.; Coon, Jaime J.; Mattes, Jenna R.; Miller, James R.] Univ Illinois, Dept Nat Resources & Environm Sci, Urbana, IL 61820 USA; [Miller, James R.] Univ Illinois, Program Ecol Evolut & Conservat Biol, Urbana, IL 61820 USA",timothy.swartz@temple.edu,67,4,4,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,LAND-BASEL,Land,2019,"Green Submitted, gold",

Private conservation easements (CEs) have proliferated in the United States, yet assessing landscape-level function is confounded by varying extent, resolution, and temporal scale. Objectives We developed and tested an assessment tool to evaluate interacting spatial, social, and environmental attributes of easements relative to the degree of human modification (HM). We hypothesized that on both private and public conservation properties HM would be lower than on non-conserved parcels, and that for fine-scale features (most CEs), the level of HM would be driven by the variables used to create the coarser scale HM measure. Methods Variation in HM between private, public, and non-conserved was tested via pairwise parcel sampling. Composition was evaluated using multiple geographic bounds and edge characteristics. We assessed both environmental and social predictors using multinomial logistic regression. Results Privately conserved lands did not differ significantly from non-conserved lands. Publicly conserved lands had lower HM than both privately conserved and non-conserved lands. Edge contrast was similar between private and matched non-conserved patches. The level of HM was not driven by distance to roads, or by elevation in this mixed-use setting. Conclusions Variation in tests for differences, land characteristics, and HM variables confirmed the significantly lower HM of publicly protected lands, and opens the question as to naturalness of easements in some contexts. CEs in this location may be representative of the mixed rural-forested landscape instead of more natural land cover.","[Fouch, Nakisha] Clemson Univ, Dept Forestry & Environm Conservat, 118A Lehotsky Hall, Clemson, SC 29634 USA; [Baldwin, Robert F.] Clemson Univ, Dept Forestry & Environm Conservat, 261 Lehotsky Hall, Clemson, SC 29634 USA; [Gerard, Patrick] Clemson Univ, Dept Math Sci, O-114 Martin Hall, Clemson, SC 29634 USA; [Dyckman, Caitlin] Clemson Univ, Dept City Planning & Real Estate Dev, 2-319 Lee Hall, Clemson, SC 29634 USA; [Theobald, David M.] Conservat Sci Partners, 5 Old Town Sq Suite 205, Ft Collins, CO 80524 USA",nfouch@clemson.edu,77,7,7,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-2973,LANDSCAPE ECOL,Landsc.

However, different protected area categories can vary substantially in their degree of enforcement, which may ensure different levels of effectiveness for biodiversity protection. Because little attempt has been made to quantify this, we investigated the protection effectiveness of different levels of protection (low, intermediate, and high) in maintaining the ecological functions of mammalian species. We assessed this on a selection of five species with varying ecological functions: nine-banded armadillo (insectivore), paca (seed disperser), tayra (omnivore), ocelot (carnivore), and collared peccary (seed predator). Their occupancy probability and the integrity of their ecological functions were estimated and spatialized across landscapes at all protection levels (low, intermediate, and high). In addition, we estimated how many of these species were maintained in each protection status using a minimum of 35% occupancy threshold for each. Our results indicated that higher protection statuses can hold more ecological functions of these mammalian species than areas with lower protection levels. Ocelot and paca heavily relied on areas with higher protection, which can impact the overall ecosystem functioning and ecological services of less protected areas, since these are species performing unique roles in our landscape (mixed-sized prey carnivory and large-sized seed dispersal, respectively). Our study suggests that the degrees of protection can influence the area effectiveness in maintaining certain mammalian species and their ecological functions and ecosystem services. Therefore, management strategies and degree of enforcement should be carefully planned when assigning areas for conservation to ensure the conservation of more sensitive species and preserve more ecological functions.","[Nagy-Reis, Mariana B.; Setz, Eleonore Z.

Assessing the outcome of a conservation intervention is thus key to improving its efficiency. This is often done by comparing an intervention to a control. Comparative effectiveness studies, on the other hand, compare multiple conservation interventions among each other. In doing so, one can determine which are the most beneficial interventions despite the lack of a control and a formal experimental design. We use an amphibian conservation study to discuss the benefits and limits of this approach. We used the comparative effectiveness approach to evaluate the outcome of a pond creation project. We measured habitat variables at three spatial scales (pond, terrestrial microhabitat, and landscape) and used multistate occupancy and N-mixture models to account for imperfect detection and to relate the explanatory variables to pond colonization, species abundance and the presence of tadpoles (i.e., evidence for successful reproduction). Although characteristics of the created ponds mattered, the availability of suitable terrestrial microhabitat (such as dry stone walls) was even more important in terms of conservation success as measured by colonization and abundance. This case study shows that successful amphibian conservation action depends on landscape complementation, i.e., the paired availability of suitable aquatic and terrestrial microhabitat. We conclude that comparative effectiveness studies can be used to provide critical information for improved conservation action. However, small sample size and a lack of randomization may a priori represent an impediment to strong inference. Nevertheless, comparative effectiveness studies can provide valuable guidance for evidence-based conservation.","[Schmidt, Benedikt R.] Univ Zurich, Dept Evolutionary Biol & Environm Studies, Winterthurerstr 190, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland; [Schmidt, Benedikt R.] Info Fauna Karch, Batiment G,Bellevaux 51, CH-2000 Neuchatel, Switzerland; [Arlettaz, Raphael; Kropfli, Madeleine] Univ Bern, Inst Ecol & Evolut, Div Conservat Biol, Baltzerstr 6, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland; [Arlettaz, Raphael; Schaub, Michael] Schweiz Vogelwarte, Seerose 1, CH-6204 Sempach, Switzerland; [Luscher, Beatrice] Info Fauna Karch Reg Vertretung Kanton Bern Amphi, Schwand 3, CH-3110 Munsingen, Switzerland",benedikt.schmidt@ieu.uzh.ch,89,9,9,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0006-3207,BIOL CONSERV,Biol.

We investigated fishers' LEK on migratory patterns of seven fish species along 550km of the Tapajos River, in the Brazilian Amazon.

The interviewed fishers indicated that three fish species do not migrate over long distances, while four fish species perform migrations, usually longitudinal migration from downstream to upstream reaches. Fishers also mentioned an increase in size of a large catfish species in the upstream stretches of the studied river, indicating the potential occurrence of spawning adults there. These results from fishers' knowledge indicated that planned dams in the upstream reaches of the Tapajos River will threaten migratory fishes, small-scale fisheries and food security. Fishers' LEK on fish migration contributed to raise testable biological hypotheses about fish spawning and feeding grounds, as well as the occurrence of distinct populations along the river.

Periodically, the state deploys the military and the police to clamp down on ASM for destroying the environment, but treats with kid gloves foreign companies engaged in large-scale mining (LSM), wreaking similar disastrous ecological effects on mining communities. The state believes that LSM by foreign companies is a source of foreign direct investment (FDI) and foreign mining companies should be incentivized to come and stay in the country. Presented in broad brush strokes as illegal (galamsey), the Ghanaian state sees ASM as an environmental menace to be fought with all the coercive apparatuses that it can command Disputing this claim, the article argues that mining-FDI is essentially ecological imperialism, wreaking havoc on the ecosystem of mining communities whose livelihood strategies are in conflict with the accumulation and political interests of foreign mining companies and the Ghanaian political class respectively. The article demonstrates that concerns over the harmful impacts of mining on the ecology of Ghana are neither class-neutral nor free of politics. They are rather highly imbricated in power structures and relations, in which the interest of the ruling class is supreme in the enforcement of environmental regulations in Ghana The paradox of the biases of the Ghanaian state against ASM, particularly ASM operated by its own citizens for survival, and in favor of foreign mining companies engaged in LSM for profits, is explained with the insights of ecological imperialism.","[Ayelazuno, Jasper Abembia] Univ Dev Studies, Tamale, Ghana; [Mawuko-Yevugah, Lord] Ghana Inst Management & Publ Adm, Accra, Ghana",abembia@yahoo.com; lmawuko@gimpa.edu.gh,69,2,2,UNIV ARIZONA LIBRARIES,TUCSON,"UNIV ARIZONA LIBRARIES, TUCSON, AZ 85721 USA",1073-0451,J POLIT ECOL,J.

The introduction of alien invasive species and their interaction with the native fauna represent some of the major threats to the survival of this species. Currently, the genetic variability of the Mediterranean trout is being compromised by the introgressive hybridization with the Atlantic trout (Salmo trutta Linnaeus, 1758). Therefore, it is necessary to gain further knowledge on genetic and demographic characteristics of Mediterranean trout populations, that, combined with environmental and angling data, will allow to undertake sound conservation strategies. The aims of the present study were to analyze: i) the demographic characteristics of the Mediterranean trout in seven central Apennine river basins where native populations are threatened by stocking with the domestic trout of north Atlantic origin; ii) the influence of both environmental parameters and different fishery management strategies on the status of native trout populations. The project focuses on 14 sites included in the Natura 2000 EU wide network of nature protection areas, established under the 1992 Habitat Directive. A total of 25 watercourses were investigated for a total of 32 sampling sites. A census of the fish fauna was carried out by electrofishing at each sampling location. Fish and environmental data were collected in spring and autumn 2014. The results obtained in the present research allowed us to detect the presence of three residual Mediterranean trout populations with a high degree of genetic integrity in the study area. The native trout populations were characterized by higher abundances and higher adult density values. Well-structured native populations with higher legal-size specimens density and poor body conditions in terms of relative weight were observed in the no-fishing areas, probably due to the presence of intraspecific competition phenomena. The environmental analysis confirmed the key role played by the geological characteristics of the central Apennines in shaping the introgression levels observed in the wild trout populations, while the recovery of the water quality appears decisive in the development of management strategies aimed at their conservation.","[Lorenzoni, Massimo; Carosi, Antonella; La Porta, Gianandrea] Univ Perugia, Dept Chem Biol & Biotechnol, Via Elce di Sotto, Perugia, Italy; [Giovannotti, Massimo; Splendiani, Andrea; Caputo Barucchi, Vincenzo] Univ Politecn Marche, DiSVA, Via Brecce Bianche, Ancona, Italy",antonella.carosi@unipg.it,82,5,5,PAGEPRESS PUBL,PAVIA,"MEDITGROUP, VIA G BELLI, 4, PAVIA, 27100, ITALY",1129-5767,J LIMNOL,J.

Calls for urgent conservation action have been prompted by the increasing pace of development and declines in biodiversity, including songbirds. To assist conservation decision making, we introduce a framework to facilitate selection of the highest priority areas for a given conservation objective. We varied six key decision points representing possible constraints or a priori conservation factors: (1) prioritization metric (species representation vs. diversity), (2) geographic stratification, (3) degree of anthropogenic disturbance, (4) species' conservation status, (5) species' ecological association, and (6) climate-change and uncertainty discounting. Using the Zonation conservation planning tool, we evaluated landbird conservation priorities across 128 scenarios for 63 passerine species based on current and projected future density predictions. We compared Zonation land rankings across scenarios with respect to consistency, efficiency (additive and proportional conservation value per unit area), and the relative contributions of each of the six factors of interest. We found large differences between solutions depending on constraints and conservation objectives, and relatively low conservation efficiency overall, with the largest gains in overall conservation value observed in areas ranging from 0.31-0.56 of the study region. This reflects the large range of conservation opportunities still present in the Canadian boreal region, and the widely dispersed nature of landbird distributions, which results in high substitutability among similar areas. However, we did find increasing consistency among solutions as multiple constraints were considered. In particular, stratifying solutions geographically resulted in more consistent priorities, although at the expense of efficiency. Other constraints, including climate change, disturbance- and uncertainty-discounting, and the selection and weighting of species, helped to further focus priorities. Although no single scenario can be viewed as prescriptive, we provide a roadmap for prioritizing boreal songbird conservation efforts across multiple conservation objectives.","[Stralberg, Diana; Westwood, Alana; Barker, Nicole K.

Ecological integrity loss is defined as the inability to sustain viable populations, habitat functions, and species interactions of Nearctic and Neotropical apex predators as a result of anthropogenic effects. As direct impacts, the indicators evaluate habitat loss and the number of inhospitable habitats. As indirect impacts, the indicators evaluate the avoidance of human features such as highways, roads, and human locations. The total impact level is described at 1km(2) resolution, and registered within the domain defined by the spatial habitat requirements of apex predators. The impact level is associated with ecological integrity loss, or the ecosystem capacity to reorganize habitat functions and sustain predator-prey interactions as the most visible elements of ecological integrity. Ecological integrity loss is evaluated for different groups of apex predators that are classified with different levels of anthropogenic threat.ResultsThe framework presented here identifies the spatial information needed for the assessment of cumulative anthropogenic impacts. By characterizing their distribution range, Nearctic predators have significantly larger intact habitats than neotropical predators but with higher ecological degradation, less landscape transformation, and overall less ecological integrity. As observed within their distribution areas, indirect impacts have a generalized effect in the broad range of landscapes in Mexico. Ecological integrity loss is the result of road, highway, and human settlement avoidance; but landscape transformation and human activity control the threshold for which ecological integrity loss becomes critical. On the other hand, there are no significant differences in impact levels among threat conservation categories for apex predators, which indicate that all predator species have the same threat level and should be all included in protection efforts.ConclusionsWith the application of this spatial framework, the significance, scale, and baseline conditions can be established for evaluating anthropogenic impacts on ecological integrity. The analysis of the current condition shows the status for apex predator in the country, and identifies the ecological integrity threshold when human activities have severe to highly severe impacts in the landscape, threatening the viability of populations and their habitat.","[Mora, Franz] Comis Nacl Conocimiento & Uso Biodiversidad CONAB, Coordinac Sistema Informac Espacial Soporte Decis, Liga Perifer Insurgentes Sur 4903, Col Parques Del Pedregal 14010, Delegacion Tlal, Mexico",fmora@conabio.gob.mx,74,1,1,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",,ECOL PROCESS,Ecol.

Over the last 10 years, the number of marine SCP studies has increased exponentially, yet there is no structured or reliable way to find information on methods, trends, and progress. The rapid growth in methods and marine applications warrants an updated analysis of the literature, as well as reflection on the need for continuous and systematic documentation of SCP exercises in general. To address these gaps, we developed a database to document SCP exercises and populated it with 155 marine SCP exercises found in the primary literature. Based on our review, we provide an update on global advances and trends in marine SCP literature. We found accelerating growth in the number of studies over the past decade, with increasing consideration of socioeconomic variables, land-sea planning, and ecological connectivity. While several studies aimed to inform conservation decisions, we found little evidence of input from practitioners. There are important gaps in geographic coverage and little correspondence with areas most threatened. Five countries lead most studies, but their networks suggest potential for capacity building through collaborations. The varying quality and detail in documentation of studies confirmed the limited opportunities to develop and assess the application of best practice in conservation planning. A global database to track the development, implementation, and impact of SCP applications can thus provide numerous benefits. Our database constitutes an important step towards the development of a centralized repository of information on planning exercises and can serve several roles to advance SCP theory and practice: it facilitates assessing geographic coverage and gaps; scientists and practitioners can access information to identify trends in the use of data, methods, and tools; reviewers and editors of journals can assess whether studies have covered important literature and developments; donors and non-government organizations can identify regions needing further work; and practitioners and policy-makers can learn from previous plans.","[Alvarez-Romero, Jorge G.; Adams, Vanessa M.; Gurney, Georgina G.; Pressey, Robert L.; Weeks, Rebecca; Cheok, Jessica; Day, Jon C.; Hamel, Melanie A.; Magris, Rafael A.] James Cook Univ, Australian Res Council, Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Mills, Morena; Adams, Vanessa M.] Univ Queensland, Sch Biol Sci, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia; [Mills, Morena] Imperial Coll London, Dept Life Sci, London SL5 7PY, Berks, England; [Adams, Vanessa M.] Univ Tasmania, Sch Technol Environm & Design, Geog & Spatial Sci, Sch Technol, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia; [Ban, Natalie C.; Davies, Tammy E.] Univ Victoria, Sch Environm Studies, STN CSC, POB 1700, Victoria, BC, Canada; [Davies, Tammy E.] BirdLife Int, Cambridge CB2 3QZ, England; [Leslie, Heather M.] Univ Maine, Darling Marine Ctr, Walpole, ME 04573 USA; [Magris, Rafael A.] Brazilian Minist Environm, Chico Mendes Inst Biodivers Conservat, BR-7067037 Brasilia, DF, Brazil; [Storlie, Collin J.] James Cook Univ, eRes Ctr, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia",jorge.alvarez.romero@gmail.com; m.mills@imperial.ac.uk; vm.adams@utas.edu.au; georgina.gurney@gmail.com; bob.pressey@jcu.edu.au; rebecca.weeks@jcu.edu.au; nban@uvic.ca; jessica.cheok@my.jcu.edu.au; tammy.davies@birdlife.org; jon.day@my.jcu.edu.au; melanie.hamel@my.jcu.edu.au; heather.leslie@maine.edu; collin.storlie@jcu.edu.au,76,35,35,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0006-3207,BIOL CONSERV,Biol.

Silvopastures (i.e. pastures with substantial tree cover), in particular, possess considerable potential for conserving biodiversity due to the dominance of pastoral landscapes in many regions. However, to balance tradeoffs between the conservation and agricultural values of these anthropogenic systems, better information on wildlife use and how it relates to habitat quality is needed. To improve our mechanistic understanding of silvopastoral habitat quality, and to develop management recommendations, we evaluated the foraging behavior of insectivorous forest birds in Andean silvopastures compared with forest fragments. Focal species' prey attack rates were >25% lower in silvopastures than in forest fragments, suggesting that arthropod prey were less abundant or accessible in silvopastures than in forest fragments. In forest fragments, birds in mixed-species foraging flocks attacked prey more frequently than solitary birds. In silvopastures, flocking and solitary birds attacked prey at similar rates, and birds foraged in flocks half as frequently as in forest fragments. Insectivorous birds preferentially foraged in a small subset of tree genera in forest fragments, but did not exhibit selective foraging in less botanically diverse silvopastures. Insectivorous species that used silvopastures foraged in microhabitats such as vine tangles and hanging dead leaves less frequently than species that did not use silvopastures. Forest species that used silvopastures may have been negatively affected by a breakdown of beneficial interspecific interactions in silvopastures, highlighting the potential for cascading effects of species loss in anthropogenic habitats. Managing silvopastures to include preferred tree species and microhabitats could improve their habitat quality for forest species, but strategies to enhance the conservation value of managed landscapes with silvopastures must also include preservation of forest fragments.","[Tarbox, Bryan C.; Flory, S.

Conservation management generally rests on discrete categories, such as identified species, and, for threated taxa, intraspecific units. Species, in particular, provide a common measure of biodiversity yet in both theory and nature, speciation is typically a protracted process progressing from connected populations to unambiguous species with variable rates of phenotypic, ecological and genetic divergence. Thus, most recognized species are not genetically uniform and are sometimes highly structured into historically isolated populations worthy of consideration as intraspecific units that represent unique genetic diversity for conservation. Genome screens offer unprecedented resolution of structure across taxonomic boundaries in species complexes, and have the potential to oversplit species if not interpreted conservatively. This highlights the blurred line between populations and species, and can confound simple dichotomies of species vs. not species. At the same time, like plants, there is increasing evidence that even distantly related animal species can hybridize and exchange genes. A review of conservation legislation reveals that legal definitions of species are quite flexible and can accommodate a range of infra-specifictaxa and divergent populations, as well as taxonomically recognized species. For example, the legislative definition of a species around the world can include: species, subspecies, varieties, and geographically and/or genetically distinct populations. In principle, this flexibility allows for protection of genetic diversity and maintenance of evolutionary processes at a broad range of infra-specific levels. However, evolutionary biologists often fail to adequately justify and then translate their evidence for genetically defined units into categories suited to assessment under local legislation. We recommend that (i) genomic data should be interpreted conservatively when formally naming species, (ii) concomitantly, there should be stronger impetus and a more uniform approach to identifying clearly justified intraspecific units, (iii) guidelines be developed for recognizing and labeling intraspecific data that align with best scientific practice, and (iv) that the more nuanced view of species and speciation emerging from genomic analyses is communicated more effectively by scientists to decision makers.","[Coates, David J.; Byrne, Margaret] Dept Biodivers Conservat & Attract, Biodivers & Conservat Sci, Kensington, WA, Australia; [Moritz, Craig] Australian Natl Univ, Div Ecol & Evolut, Res Sch Biol, Acton, ACT, Australia; [Moritz, Craig] Ctr Biodivers Anal, Canberra, ACT, Australia",Dave.Coates@dbca.wa.gov.au,121,126,128,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",2296-701X,FRONT ECOL EVOL,Front.

Yet our ability to measure, monitor and forecast biodiversity change - crucial to addressing it - remains limited. Biodiversity monitoring systems are being developed to improve this capacity by deriving metrics of change from an array of insitu data (e.g. field plots or species occurrence records) and Earth observations (EO; e.g. satellite or airborne imagery). However, there are few ecologically based frameworks for integrating these data into meaningful metrics of biodiversity change. Here, I describe how concepts of pattern and scale in ecology could be used to design such a framework. I review three core topics: the role of scale in measuring and modelling biodiversity patterns with EO, scale-dependent challenges linking insitu and EO data and opportunities to apply concepts of pattern and scale to EO to improve biodiversity mapping. From this analysis emerges an actionable approach for measuring, monitoring and forecasting biodiversity change, highlighting key opportunities to establish EO as the backbone of global-scale, science-driven conservation.","[Anderson, Christopher B.] Stanford Univ, Dept Biol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Anderson, Christopher B.] Stanford Univ, Ctr Conservat Biol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",cbanders@stanford.edu,166,53,54,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1461-023X,ECOL LETT,Ecol.

Although equids were extirpated from North America 10,000-12,000 years ago, descendants of domestic horses now roam freely in the USA and 17 other countries across six continents. In landscape-scale and experimental investigations, free-roaming horses (Equus caballus) have been shown to induce numerous alterations to native-ecosystem components and processes through influences on soil, water, plants, and other aspects of biodiversity. However, we argue that the management of free-roaming horses both in the U.S. and globally has been complicated by socio-ecological mismatches. Such mismatches arise from an inability to reconcile conflicting processes and functions in a social-ecological system, often reflecting differences in the spatio-temporal scales at which diverse components operate. Here, we describe three types of mismatches, and illustrate how the ecological dynamics of aridlands generally fit poorly with existing approaches to horse management and policy. Such mismatches complicate cost-effective management of free-roaming horses and the ecosystems they inhabit, and reduce the palette of potential solutions.","[Beever, Erik A.] US Geol Survey, Northern Rocky Mt Sci Ctr, 2327 Univ Way,Ste 2, Bozeman, MT 59715 USA; [Beever, Erik A.] Montana State Univ, Dept Ecol, POB 173460, Bozeman, MT 59717 USA; [Huntsinger, Lynn] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Environm Sci Policy & Management, 130 Hilgard Hall, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Petersen, Steven L.] Brigham Young Univ, Plant & Wildlife Sci Dept, 5027 LSB, Provo, UT 84602 USA",EBeever@usgs.gov; Huntsinger@berkeley.edu; Steven_Petersen@byu.edu,62,12,12,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0006-3207,BIOL CONSERV,Biol.

Correcting this misalignment requires appropriate local incentives. Conservation agreements (i.e. negotiated transactions in which conservation investors finance social benefits in return for conservation actions by communities) are a form of direct incentive. The results of this approach depend on effective monitoring of ecological and socio-economic impacts to verify that environmental and development objectives are met. Monitoring is also needed to verify that parties to the agreements comply with their commitments. Ecological monitoring results for agreements between Conservation International and communities in the Colombian Amazon show positive conservation impacts. These agreements are designed to protect forest areas and two threatened fish species that are important to local livelihoods and have high commercial value. We show how effective monitoring is essential for identifying long-term sustainability options.

To better understand how carnivore communities are structured, we analysed camera trap data for 108087 trap days across 12 countries spanning five continents. We estimate local probabilities of co-occurrence among 768 species pairs from the order Carnivora and evaluate how shared ecological traits correlate with probabilities of co-occurrence. Within individual study areas, species pairs co-occurred more frequently than expected at random. Co-occurrence probabilities were greatest for species pairs that shared ecological traits including similar body size, temporal activity pattern and diet. However, co-occurrence decreased as compared to other species pairs when the pair included a large-bodied carnivore. Our results suggest that a combination of shared traits and top-down regulation by large carnivores shape local carnivore communities globally.","[Davis, Courtney L.; Murphy, Asia J.; Miller, David A.

Identifying which factors contribute to their success or failure is crucial considering the international conservation targets for 2020 and the limited funds generally available for marine conservation. We identified common factors of success and/or failure of MPA effectiveness using peer-reviewed publications and first-hand expert knowledge for 27 case studies around the world. We found that stakeholder engagement was considered to be the most important factor affecting MPA success, and equally, its absence, was the most important factor influencing failure. Conversely, while some factors were identified as critical for success, their absence was not considered a driver of failure, and vice versa. This mismatch provided the impetus for considering these factors more critically. Bearing in mind that most MPAs have multiple objectives, including non-biological, this highlights the need for the development and adoption of standardized effectiveness metrics, besides biological considerations, to measure factors contributing to the success or failure of MPAs to reach their objectives. Considering our conclusions, we suggest the development of specific protocols for the assessment of stakeholder engagement, the role of leadership, the capacity of enforcement and compliance with MPAs objectives. Moreover, factors defining the success and failure of MPAs should be assessed not only by technical experts and the relevant authorities, but also by other stakeholder groups whose compliance is critical for the successful functioning of an MPA. These factors should be considered along with appropriate ecological, social, and economic data and then incorporated into adaptive management to improve MPA effectiveness.","[Giakoumi, Sylvaine; McGowan, Jennifer; Mills, Morena; Beger, Maria; Maina, Joseph M.; Possingham, Hugh P.] Univ Queensland, ARC Ctr Excellence Environm Decis, Sch Biol Sci, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Giakoumi, Sylvaine; Guidetti, Paolo] Univ Cote Azur, CNRS, FRE 3729 ECOMERS, Nice, France; [Mills, Morena] Imperial Coll London, Dept Life Sci, Silwood Pk, Ascot, Berks, England; [Beger, Maria] Univ Leeds, Fac Biol Sci, Sch Biol Sci, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England; [Bustamante, Rodrigo H.] CSIRO Oceans & Atmosphere Res, Ecosci Precinct, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Charles, Anthony] St Marys Univ, Sch Environm, Halifax, NS, Canada; [Charles, Anthony] St Marys Univ, Sch Business, Halifax, NS, Canada; [Christie, Patrick] Univ Washington, Sch Marine & Environm Affairs, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Christie, Patrick] Univ Washington, Jackson Sch Int Studies, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Fox, Matthew; McCook, Laurence] Conservat Int, Bali, Indonesia; [Garcia-Borboroglu, Pablo] CONICET Argentina, Puerto Madryn, Argentina; [Garcia-Borboroglu, Pablo; Reyes, Laura M.] Global Penguin Soc, Puerto Madryn, Argentina; [Garcia-Borboroglu, Pablo] Univ Washington, Dept Biol, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Gelcich, Stefan] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Ciencias Biol, Ctr Appl Ecol & Sustainabil, Santiago, Chile; [Gelcich, Stefan] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Ctr Conservac Marina, Santiago, Chile; [Guidetti, Paolo] Natl Intennivers Consortium Marine Sci CoNISMa, Rome, Italy; [Mackelworth, Peter] Blue World Inst Marine Res & Conservat, Veli Losinj, Croatia; [Mackelworth, Peter] Univ Primorska, Dept Biodivers, FAMNIT, Koper, Slovenia; [McCook, Laurence] James Cook Univ, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld, Australia; [McCook, Laurence] Chinese Acad Sci, South China Sea Inst Oceanol, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Micheli, Fiorenza] Stanford Univ, Hopkins Matine Stn, Pacific Grove, CA USA; [Micheli, Fiorenza] Stanford Univ, Stanford Ctr Ocean Solut, Pacific Grove, CA USA; [Morgan, Lance E.] Marine Conservat Inst, Glen Ellen, CA USA; [Mumby, Peter J.] Univ Queensland, Sch Biol Sci, Marine Spatial Ecol Lab, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Reyes, Laura M.] Univ Nacl Patagonia San Juan Bosco, Puerto Madryn, Argentina; [White, Alan] Nature Conservancy, Asia Pacific Program, Honolulu, HI USA; [White, Alan] Tetra Tech ARD, USAID Sustainable Ecosyst Adv Project, Jakarta, Indonesia; [Grorud-Colvert, Kirsten] Oregon State Univ, Dept Integrat Biol, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Possingham, Hugh P.] Nature Conservancy, 1815 N Lynn St, Arlington, VA USA",sylvaine.giakoumi1@gmail.com,24,97,97,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,FRONT MAR SCI,Front.

Ecological representation in protected areas is crucial for assessment on the progress toward conservation targets. Although China has established a large number of protected areas since the 1950s, ecological representation of protected areas is poorly understood. Here, we performed the complementarity analysis to evaluate ecological representation of protected areas in China. We used a database of the geographical distribution for 10,396 woody plant species, 2,305 fern species, 406 amphibian species, 460 reptile species, 1,364 bird species, and 590 mammal species from 2,376 counties across China. We identified complementary sets of counties for all species or threatened species of plant and vertebrate species using a complementarity algorithm. We evaluated ecological representation of 3,627 protected areas and discerned conservation gaps by comparing the distribution of protected areas with complementary sets. The results show that the spatially representative and complementary sites for biodiversity are poorly covered, and a fairly large proportion of protected areas is not designed to efficiently represent biodiversity at the national scale. Our methodology can serve as a generic framework for assessment on ecological representation of protected areas at the national scale.","[Xu, Haigen; Cao, Mingchang; Wang, Zhi; Cao, Yun; Wu, Jun; Le, Zhifang; Cui, Peng; Ding, Hui; Xu, Wanggu; Xia, Xin] Minist Environm Protect, Nanjing Inst Environm Sci, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Wu, Yi] Nanjing Forestry Univ, Coll Forest Resources & Environm, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Cao, Yun] Nanjing Univ, Coll Life Sci, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Peng, Hua] Chinese Acad Sci, Kunming Inst Bot, Kunming, Yunnan, Peoples R China; [Jiang, Jianping] Chinese Acad Sci, Chengdu Inst Biol, Chengdu, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Wu, Yuhu] Chinese Acad Sci, Northwest Inst Plateau Biol, Xining, Qinghai, Peoples R China; [Jiang, Xuelong; Rao, Dingqi] Chinese Acad Sci, Kunming Inst Zool, Kunming, Yunnan, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Zhiyun] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Bot, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Li, Jianqiang] Chinese Acad Sci, Wuhan Bot Garden, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Lei, Fumin] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Zool, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Xia, Nianhe] Chinese Acad Sci, South China Bot Garden, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Han, Lianxian] Southwest Forestry Univ, Coll Forestry, Kunming, Yunnan, Peoples R China; [Cao, Wei] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Appl Ecol, Shenyang, Liaoning, Peoples R China; [Wu, Jiayu] Peking Univ, Coll Urban & Environm Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Li, Yimin] Jiangsu Univ, Fac Sci, Zhenjiang, Peoples R China",xhg@nies.org; llym@ujs.edu.cn,54,14,15,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

However, by analysing the application of biodiversity offsets, this article shows that there are significant organizational limitations to implementing the tool effectively. Our analysis of the tool is framed by the articulation of public policy and strategic analysis, and based on empirical case studies of French linear infrastructure projects. Three organizational limitations are identified: restrictive regulatory procedures, negotiations about appropriate ecological targets which are affected by unbalanced power relationships; and a preference for unambitious but realistic measures that are more likely to be implemented. These realities of biodiversity offsetting in practice have three detrimental effects on the conservation sector: they saturate the capacity of administrative organizations responsible for nature conservation; they destabilize nature protection associations looking for funding; and they generate ambiguity about protected area policies. As a consequence, implementation of the tool demands substantial human resource input for limited ecological gain. It destabilizes conservation policies and weakens environmental stakeholders. The latter should get involved themselves in biodiversity offset activities only if this involvement provides additional resources for their core conservation activities. By designing and managing areas for conservation, these activities also frame spatially the previous steps of the mitigation sequence. These conclusions suggest that we should not prioritize biodiversity offsetting as a tool for biodiversity conservation within biodiversity strategies.","[Guillet, Fanny; Semal, Luc] Natl Museum Nat Hist, Ctr Ecol & Conservat Sci, Paris, France",fanny.guillet@mnhn.fr,32,15,15,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0006-3207,BIOL CONSERV,Biol.

These models have been widely implemented in upland rangelands, but comparatively, little attention has been given to developing ecological site concepts for rangeland riparian areas, and additional environmental criteria may be necessary to classify riparian ecological sites. Between 2013 and 2016, fifteen study reaches on five creeks were studied at Tejon Ranch in southern California. Data were collected to describe the relationship between riparian vegetation composition, environmental variables, and livestock management; and to explore the utility of ecological sites and state-and-transition models for describing riparian vegetation communities and for creating hypotheses about drivers of vegetation change. Hierarchical cluster analysis was used to classify the environmental and vegetation data (15 stream reachesx4years) into two ecological sites and eight community phases that comprised three vegetation states. Classification and regression tree (CART) analysis was used to determine the influence of abiotic site variables, annual precipitation, and cattle activity on vegetation clusters. Channel slope explained the greatest amount of variation in vegetation clusters; however, soil texture, geology, watershed size, and elevation were also selected as important predictors of vegetation composition. The classification tree built with this limited set of abiotic predictor variables explained 90% of the observed vegetation clusters. Cattle grazing and annual precipitation were not linked to qualitative differences in vegetation. Abiotic variables explained almost all of the observed riparian vegetation dynamicsand the divisions in the CART analysis corresponded roughly to the ecological sitessuggesting that ecological sites are well-suited for understanding and predicting change in this highly variable system. These findings support continued development of riparian ecological site concepts and state-and-transition models to aid decision making for conservation and management of rangeland riparian areas.","[Ratcliff, Felix; Bartolome, James; Macaulay, Luke] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Environm Sci Policy & Management, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Spiegal, Sheri] USDA ARS Jornada Expt Range, Las Cruces, NM USA; [White, Michael D.] Tejon Ranch Conservancy, Frazier Pk, CA USA",felixratcliff@berkeley.edu,38,4,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

In some countries, organizations use revolving-fund programs, whereby land is purchased and then sold to conservation-minded owners under condition they enter into a conservation covenant or easement. The sale proceeds are used to purchase, protect, and sell additional properties, incrementally increasing the amount of protected private land. Because the effectiveness of this approach relies on selecting appropriate properties, we explored factors currently considered by practitioners and how these are integrated into decision making. We conducted exploratory, semistructured interviews with managers from each of the 5 major revolving funds in Australia. Responses indicated although conservation factors are important, financial and social factors are also highly influential. A major determinant was whether the property could be resold within a reasonable period at a price that replenishes the fund. To facilitate resale, often selected properties include the potential for the construction of a dwelling. Practitioners face with clear trade-offs between conservation, financial, amenity, and other factors in selecting properties and 3 main challenges: recovering the costs of acquisition, protection, and resale; reselling the property; and meeting conservation goals. Our findings suggest the complexity of these decisions may constrain revolving-fund effectiveness. Drawing from participant responses, we identified potential strategies to mitigate these risks, such as providing adequate recreational space without jeopardizing ecological assets. We suggest managers could benefit from a shared-learning and adaptive approach to property selection given the commonalities between programs. Understanding how practitioners deal with complex decisions in the implementation of revolving funds helps identify future research to improve the performance of this conservation tool.","[Hardy, Mathew J.; Bekessy, Sarah A.; Gordon, Ascelin] RMIT Univ, Sch Global Urban & Social Studies, GPO Box 2476, Melbourne, Vic 3001, Australia; [Hardy, Mathew J.; Bekessy, Sarah A.] RMIT Univ, ARC Ctr Excellence Environm Decis, Melbourne, Vic 3001, Australia; [Fitzsimons, James A.] Nature Conservancy, POB 57, Carlton, Vic 3053, Australia; [Fitzsimons, James A.] Deakin Univ, Sch Life & Environm Sci, 221 Burwood Highway, Burwood, Vic 3125, Australia",mat.hardy@rmit.edu.au,43,6,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0888-8892,CONSERV BIOL,Conserv.

Social-ecological vulnerability offers a valuable framework for identifying and understanding important social-ecological linkages, and the implications of dependencies and other feedback loops in the system. Unfortunately, its implementation at local scales has hitherto been limited due at least in part to the lack of operational tools for spatial representation of social-ecological vulnerability. We developed a method to map social-ecological vulnerability based on information on human-nature dependencies and ecosystem services at local scales. We applied our method to the small-scale fishery of Moorea, French Polynesia, by combining spatially explicit indicators of exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity of both the resource (i.e., vulnerability of reef fish assemblages to fishing) and resource users (i.e., vulnerability of fishing households to the loss of fishing opportunity). Our results revealed that both social and ecological vulnerabilities varied considerably through space and highlighted areas where sources of vulnerability were high for both social and ecological subsystems (i.e., social-ecological vulnerability hotspots) and thus of high priority for management intervention. Our approach can be used to inform decisions about where biodiversity conservation strategies are likely to be more effective and how social impacts from policy decisions can be minimized. It provides a new perspective on human-nature linkages that can help guide sustainability management at local scales; delivers insights distinct from those provided by emphasis on a single vulnerability component (e.g., exposure); and demonstrates the feasibility and value of operationalizing the social-ecological vulnerability framework for policy, planning, and participatory management decisions.","[Thiault, Lauric; Claudet, Joachim] PSL Res Univ, Natl Ctr Sci Res, UPVD, CRIOBE,EPHE,CNRS,USR 3278, Paris, France; [Thiault, Lauric; Collin, Antoine; Claudet, Joachim] Lab Excellence CORAIL, Perpignan, France; [Thiault, Lauric; Chlous, Frederique] MNHN, IRD, UMR208, PALOC, F-75231 Paris, France; [Thiault, Lauric; Gelcich, Stefan] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Ciencias Biol, Ctr Appl Ecol & Sustainabil CAPES, Alameda 340, Santiago, Chile; [Thiault, Lauric; Gelcich, Stefan] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Ctr Study Multiple Drivers Marine Socioecol Syst, Fac Ciencias Biol, Alameda 340, Santiago, Chile; [Marshall, Paul] Reef Ecol, Townsville, Qld 4810, Australia; [Marshall, Paul] Univ Queensland, Ctr Biodivers & Conservat Res, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia; [Collin, Antoine] PSL Res Univ, EPHE, CNRS, LETG 6554, F-35800 Dinard, France",lauric.thiault@gmail.com,48,32,33,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0888-8892,CONSERV BIOL,Conserv.

Kiwi are cryptic and rare, meaning current monitoring tools, such as call counts, radio telemetry, and surveys using detection dogs are labor-intensive, yield small datasets, and require substantial resources or provide inaccurate estimates of population sizes. A noninvasive genetic approach could help the conservation effort. We optimized a panel of 23 genetic markers (22 autosomal microsatellite loci and an allosomal marker) to discriminate between all species of kiwi and major lineages within species, while simultaneously determining sex. Markers successfully amplified from both fecal and shed feather DNA samples collected in captivity. We found that DNA extraction was more efficient from shed feathers, but DNA quality was greater with feces, although this was sampling dependent. Our microsatellite panel was able to distinguish between contemporary kiwi populations and lineages and provided PI values in the range of 4.3x10(-5) to 2.0x10(-19), which in some cases were sufficient for individualization and mark-recapture studies. As such, we have tested a wide-reaching, noninvasive molecular approach that will improve conservation management by providing better parameter estimates associated with population ecology and demographics such as abundance, growth rates, and genetic diversity.","[Ramon-Laca, Ana; White, Daniel J.] Landcare Res, Auckland, New Zealand; [White, Daniel J.] Univ Western Australia, Sch Biol Sci, Perth, WA, Australia; [Weir, Jason T.] Univ Toronto, Dept Biol Sci, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Weir, Jason T.] Univ Toronto, Dept Ecol & Evolut, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Robertson, Hugh A.] New Zealand Govt, Dept Conservat, Wellington, New Zealand",whited@landcareresearch.co.nz,64,5,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

Nonetheless, phylogenetic scale has never been formally conceptualized, and its potential remains largely unexplored. Here, we formalize the concept of phylogenetic scale, review how phylogenetic scale has been considered across multiple fields and provide practical guidelines for the use of phylogenetic scale to address a range of biological questions. Innovation: We summarize how phylogenetic scale has been treated in macroevolution, community ecology, biogeography and macroecology, illustrating how it can inform, and possibly resolve, some of the longstanding controversies in these fields. To promote the concept empirically, we define phylogenetic grain and extent, scale dependence, scaling and the domains of phylogenetic scale. We illustrate how existing phylogenetic data and statistical tools can be used to investigate the effects of scale on a variety of well-known patterns and processes, including diversification rates, community structure, niche conservatism or species-abundance distributions. Main conclusions: Explicit consideration of phylogenetic scale can provide new and more complete insight into many longstanding questions across multiple fields (macroevolution, community ecology, biogeography and macroecology).

The same holds true for large parts of Africa, but also the Philippines and the South Asian region. However, we also found that (applied) research output of developing tropical countries is nowadays on par with the output of developed countries. Vegetation and elevation were the most studied response variable and gradient, respectively. By contrast, inconspicous organisms such as oribatid mites and edaphic gradients were largely missing in the literature. Regarding biodiversity, tropical gradient studies dealt extensively with species richness and ecosystem diversity, but much less with genetic diversity. We encourage a wider use of modern statistical learning tools such as non-linear (spatio-temporal) regression and classification techniques, and simulations.

Considering biodiversity conservation as an issue of the commons and within the realm of social-ecological systems is a promising alternative. In Brazil protected areas are under a State management regime, ruled by the National System of Conservation Units. The Ecological Station of Guaraquecaba (ESG) is a no-take protected area located in the Paranagua Estuarine Complex, surrounded by traditional communities. In this article, Ostrom's design principles were adapted to assess the institutional dynamics of this protected area management, during two periods. Research methods included semi-structured interviews, participant observation and document analysis. During the first period, management actions were oriented to prevent the conversion of forest areas into anthropic occupations. The second period originated in 2000 with the creation of the National System of Conservation Units, which established more precise management tools and mechanisms for participatory decision making. In both periods there was low fulfillment of Ostrom's principles. The main changes over time were the creation of the ESG management council as a conflict-resolution mechanism, and an increase in the recognition of the rights of local communities. Yet, only three of the eight principles are totally present in the current institutional arrangement (well-defined boundaries, conflict-resolution mechanisms, and minimal recognition of rights).

It may appear difficult to integrate the long-term potential impacts of climate change within restoration strategies. However, more refined climate projections and species distribution models provide us with better understanding of likely scenarios, enabling us to consider future proofing as an integral part of the design of restoration sites, aiding plant conservation. We believe that it is possible to go one step further with a closer integration of restoration and conservation objectives. We introduce the novel concepts of protorefuges and protorefugiarestoration sites that threatened species can be translocated to, where the restoration design can be specifically adapted to help reduce the decline of threatened species at the leading and trailing edges (respectively) of bioclimatic envelope shifts.

Likewise, empirical studies within this field tend to provide detailed presentations of various uses of power, involving corporate and conservation interventions influencing access to land and natural resources. The results include struggle and conflict. Yet, there is a lack of theoretical elaboration showing how power may be understood in political ecology. In this article, we start to fill this gap by reviewing the different theoretical perspectives on power that have dominated this field. There are combinations of influences, two of them being actor-oriented and neo-Marxist approaches used from the 1980s. Typically, case studies are presented of environmental interventions by a broad range of actors at various scales from the local to the global. The focus has been on processes involving actors behind these interventions, as well as the outcomes for different social groups. Over the last two decades, in political ecology we have increasingly seen a move in power perspectives towards poststructuralist thinking about discursive power, inspired by Foucault. Today, the three approaches (actor-oriented, neo-Marxist and Foucauldian) and their combinations form a synergy of power perspectives that provide a set of rich and nuanced insights into how power is manifested in environmental conflicts and governance. We argue that combining power perspectives is one of political ecology's strengths, which should be nurtured through a continuous examination of a broad spectrum of social science theories on power.","[Svarstad, Hanne] Oslo Metropolitan Univ OsloMet, Fac Educ & Int Studies, Dev Studies, Oslo, Norway; [Benjaminsen, Tor A.] Norwegian Univ Life Sci NMBU, Fac Landscape & Soc, Dept Int Environm & Dev Studies Noragric, As, Norway; [Overa, Ragnhild] Univ Bergen, Dept Geog, Bergen, Norway",hanne.svarstad@oslomet.no; torbe@nmbu.no; ragnhild.overa@uib.no,88,58,58,UNIV ARIZONA LIBRARIES,TUCSON,"UNIV ARIZONA LIBRARIES, TUCSON, AZ 85721 USA",1073-0451,J POLIT ECOL,J.

However, if populations are genetically structured, conservation units that correspond to whole countries may be too large, putting small populations with specific conservation requirements at risk. Geoffroy's bat (Myotis emarginatus) has undergone well-documented declines at its north-western European range edge between the 1960 and 1990s and is considered to be negatively affected by habitat fragmentation. Here we analysed the species' genetic population structure and diversity to identify subpopulations with reduced genetic diversity and to scientifically inform conservation management. We generated 811 microsatellite-based genetic profiles obtained from 42 European nursery colonies and analysed a total of 932 sequences of the hypervariable region II of the mitochondrial control region sampled from across Europe. While two geographically widespread genetic populations were inferred to be present in north-western Europe, both nuclear and mitochondrial genetic diversity were lowest in the areas that had experienced a decline during the last century. A microsatellite-based analysis of demographic history did not permit, however, to unequivocally link that reduced genetic diversity to the population contraction event. Given the large geographic extent of the genetic populations, preserving the connectivity of mating sites requires concerted conservation efforts across multiple political jurisdictions. Genetic monitoring ought to be done on a regular basis to ensure that large-scale connectivity is maintained and further loss of genetic diversity is prevented.","[Frantz, Alain C.; Wilwert, Elodie; Cruz, Ana-Paula; Wittische, Julian; Weigand, Alexander M.; Buijk, Jacky; Schneider, Simone; Schleimer, Anna; Pir, Jacques B.] Musee Natl Hist Nat, 25 Rue Muenster, L-2160 Luxembourg, Luxembourg; [Viglino, Andrea] Univ Bologna, Bologna, Italy; [Wittische, Julian] Fdn Faune Flore, Luxembourg, Luxembourg; [Nyssen, Pierrette] Natagora, Namur, Belgium; [Dekeukeleire, Daan] Univ Ghent, Terr Ecol Unit, Ghent, Belgium; [Dekker, Jasja J.

Nature-based Solutions (NbS), who make full use of the natural ecosystem services, have successfully solved some economic-ecological issues, but still have unclear implementation prospects for grassland management. The Xilin Gol grassland is one of the most typical pastoral areas in China; there is a village chief named Bateer, who has already used NbS for grassland management. To confirm whether the solutions employed by Bateer have been effective for both increasing economic profits and protecting grassland ecosystem, we interviewed him, and many other herdsmen, using questionnaires about their livelihood. Based on these questionnaires, we calculated and compared their income-cost ratios. Meanwhile, we analyzed the NDVI variations inside their rangelands through high-resolution remote sensing images. The results showed that the herdsmen in Bateer's village had a much higher disposable income and income-cost ratio than others, and their rangelands also had a higher value and a more obvious increasing trend of NDVI. Bateer's success proves that the NbS can also play a positive role in grassland management, which can provide a valuable guidance for economic-ecological coordination in pastoral areas.","[Wang, Boyu; Yan, Huimin] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Wang, Boyu; Yan, Huimin] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Xue, Zhichao] Beijing Technol & Business Univ, Sch Int Econ & Management, Beijing 100048, Peoples R China; [Batunacun] Inner Mongolia Normal Univ, Coll Geog Sci, Hohhot 010022, Peoples R China; [Liu, Guihuan] Chinese Acad Environm Planning, Beijing 100012, Peoples R China",wangby.19s@igsnrr.ac.cn; yanhm@igsnrr.ac.cn; zhichao.xue@btbu.edu.cn; liugh@caep.org.cn,74,0,0,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,LAND-BASEL,Land,2022,gold,

The term traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) has entered the discourse in wildlife management and conservation; however, there can be challenges in cross-cultural communication and conceptualizations of TEK when working between Western and Indigenous paradigms. Indigenous research methodologies (IRM) is an area of scholarship intended to build ethically and culturally appropriate ways to conduct research with Indigenous communities. I implemented 7 tenets of IRM in research to explore the conceptualization of TEK and wildlife management with the Yurok Tribe of California, USA. After conducting semi-structured interviews with 20 Yurok community members from 2011 to 2013, I conducted emergent analysis and present 5 themes from the interviews related to phases of time, the conceptualization of Yurok TEK, and views on wildlife management through the Yurok cultural lens. This research may be helpful to wildlife biologists, students, academics, and others who are interested in IRM and culturally sensitive wildlife research with Indigenous communities. By bridging concepts from Indigenous studies, wildlife management, and human dimensions of wildlife, this work may serve as a nascent trajectory that creates more inclusive space for Indigenous peoples and worldviews in The Wildlife Society and other scientific disciplines.","[Ramos, Seafha C.] Univ Arizona, Sch Nat Resources & Environm, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA",seafha@gmail.com,58,0,0,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-541X,J WILDLIFE MANAGE,J.

This evidentiary challenge is compounded by misinterpretation of nonsignificant results as evidence of failed conservation practice. We illustrate a more appropriate analytical approach using a Bayesian Region of Practical Equivalence (ROPE) whereby many tests of conservation practice would be interpreted correctly as undecided rather than negative. Practitioners working with ecological cascades will increasingly be faced with undecided evidence of conservation benefits.

To assess habitat quality, proper bioindicators that allow efficient monitoring of temporal changes in habitat properties and help to understand the role of anthropogenic activities in shaping habitat characteristics, are needed. Orthopterans have been previously proposed as promising bioindicators for grassland ecosystems; however, comprehensive quantitative information on their habitat preferences is lacking, which hinders full utilization of their bioindication potential. In this study, we surveyed orthopteran assemblages and quantified local environmental conditions at 476 grassland sites in Central Europe. To model orthopteran habitat preferences, the Maxent approach was employed, which allowed us to detect continuous species responses to particular habitat characteristics (moisture, vegetation cover, vegetation height, average seasonal temperature, and direct radiation). We calculated ecological niche indices describing niche widths, species optima, and the relative importance of particular environmental variables for a total of 38 analysed species. Evaluation of final Maxent models showed that their predictive power was high for the great majority of investigated species. Red-listed species had significantly narrower niches compared to unlisted orthopterans. In addition, application of the developed quantitative ecological niche indices for ecological and conservation studies was demonstrated on an independent, previously published dataset. The development of quantitative ecological niche indices coupled with the existing time- and cost-effective survey methods, also allowing adoption of citizen science approaches, makes orthopterans an optimal model insect group for assessment of grassland condition and conservation.","[Dvorak, Tomas; Hadrava, Jiri] Charles Univ Prague, Fac Sci, Dept Zool, Vinicna 7, Prague 12844 2, Czech Republic; [Dvorak, Tomas; Knapp, Michal] Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Fac Environm Sci, Dept Ecol, Kamycka 129, Prague 16500, Czech Republic; [Hadrava, Jiri] Czech Acad Sci, Inst Entomol, Biol Ctr, Branisovska 31, Ceske Budejovice 37005, Czech Republic",dvorato1@natur.cuni.cz,83,0,0,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0006-3207,BIOL CONSERV,Biol.

Mayans' respect for nature not only guaranteed sustainable habitats but also engendered one of the most remarkable civilizations in a region that did not offer generous support for human accommodation. The Mayan world view promoted the idea of one spirit dwelling in all humans and other-than-human entities in an environment, making everything sacred and kin to everything else. The regional climate was kept under control by protecting the vegetation that also provided other ecological benefits. Land use was mixed, and residences were constructed with native and recyclable materials utilizing natural light and ventilation. The Mayan civilization inspires us to manage and protect plants, not cut them down; conserve water, not waste it; listen to the environmental feedback, not reject it; and, most importantly, it begs us to embrace nature as our own mother, not disown it as something dispensable.

The role of abiotic factors explaining parrot distribution is the most frequent ecological application. The high prevalence of studies supporting on-ground conservation problems is a remarkable example of reduction in the research-action gap. Prediction of invasion risk and assessment of invasion effect were more prevalent than examples evaluating the environmental or economic impact of these invasions.

Although bats are an important component of mammal diversity in Iran, the ecology of many species remains virtually unstudied in the country. Here we applied the maximum entropy approach to model habitat suitability of bat species in Iran, identify the most important variables for their distribution, predict high priority areas for field monitoring and conservation, and estimate the coverage of the bat species' suitable habitats by the existing protected areas. We created a richness map for the twelve species to identify high priority areas for field monitoring and conservation. The results of species distribution modeling showed that Pipistrellus kuhlii (828,977.2 km(2)) and Miniopterus pallidus (646,581.9 km(2)) had the largest distribution ranges and Rhinopoma microphyllum (211,202.7 km(2)) and Rousettus aegyptiacus (218,278.6 km(2)) had the smallest distribution ranges in Iran. By averaging the importance of each ecological variable across the 12 species, we found that distance to forests (with a negative association) is the most important ecological driver of bat distribution in Iran. The Zagros Mountains were identified as a hotspot of bats based on the distribution of the 12 species. Our findings showed that small proportions of each species suitable habitats were covered by protected areas and protected suitable habitats varied from 3.2%for Pipistrellus kuhlii to15.9% for Tadarida teniotis. This study highlights the importance of forests for bat conservation showing that forest conservation is a high priority in the country.

This guide notes that qualitative evaluation must be conducted during the survey process to reasonably predict impacts on the environment. However, quantitative evaluation with specific indicator values may also be necessary. In this study, independence analysis and logistic regression analysis were used to quantitatively evaluate railway environmental and ecological indicators.

In such landscapes, conservation biocontrol should benefit service-providing species to enhance the flow, stability and resilience of pest control services supporting the production of food and fiber. However, this would require identifying key service providers, which may be challenging when multiple predators interact with multiple pests. Here we provide a framework to identify the functional role of individual species to pest control in multifunctional landscapes. First, we used DNA metabarcoding to provide detailed data on pest species predation by diverse predator communities. Then, these data were fed into an extensive network analysis, in which information relevant for conservation biocontrol is gained from parameters describing network structure (e.g., modularity) and species roles in such network (e.g., centrality, specialization). We applied our framework to a Mediterranean landscape, where 19 bat species were found to feed on 132 insect pest species. Metabarcoding data revealed potentially important bats that consumed insect pest species in high frequency and/or diversity. Network analysis showed a modular structure, indicating sets of bat species that are required to regulate specific sets of insect pests. A few generalist bats had particularly important roles, either at network or module levels. Extinction simulations highlighted six bats, including species of conservation concern, which were sufficient to ensure that over three-quarters of the pest species had at least one bat predator. Combining DNA metabarcoding and ecological network analysis provides a valuable framework to identify individual species within diverse predator communities that might have a disproportionate contribution to pest control services in multifunctional landscapes. These species can be regarded as candidate targets for conservation biocontrol, although additional information is needed to evaluate their actual effectiveness in pest regulation.","[Mata, Vanessa A.; da Silva, Luis P.; Verissimo, Joana; Horta, Pedro; Raposeira, Helena; Rebelo, Hugo; Beja, Pedro] Univ Porto, InBIO Lab Associado, CIBIO, Ctr Invest Biodiversidade & Recursos Genet, Campus Vairao, P-4485661 Vairao, Portugal; [Mata, Vanessa A.; da Silva, Luis P.; Verissimo, Joana; Horta, Pedro; Raposeira, Helena; Rebelo, Hugo; Beja, Pedro] CIBIO, BIOPOLIS Program Genom Biodivers & Land Planning, Campus Vairao, P-4485661 Vairao, Portugal; [Verissimo, Joana; Horta, Pedro; Raposeira, Helena] Univ Porto, Dept Biol, Fac Ciencias, P-4099002 Porto, Portugal; [McCracken, Gary F.] Univ Tennessee, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA; [Rebelo, Hugo; Beja, Pedro] Univ Lisbon, Inst Super Agron, InBIO Lab Associado, CIBIO,Ctr Invest Biodiversidade & Recursos Genet, P-1349017 Lisbon, Portugal",vanessamata@cibio.up.pt,79,2,2,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1051-0761,ECOL APPL,Ecol.

This variability supports changes in rainfall and water resources across the country. Due to various developmental activities such as agriculture, industry, and services, the ever-increasing demand for surface water and groundwater resources is declining at an alarming rate. However, in India, water management and conservation projects occur in a clustered and irrational manner, often at the discretion of individuals or democratic organizations. This has prompted the country to re-examine and reevaluate the National Water Policy strategies and adopt artificial recharge of aquifers elongated with natural solutions. Given this background, this paper accentuates the necessity for a rigorous and integrated effort to decentralize water conservation and management activities by reestablishing the antiquity of conservation practices for natural resources in India. In addition, the present paper attempts to understand how changes in behavioral practices related to water have affected water availability through making synergies between surface water, groundwater, and energy to achieve water efficiency and accessibility in the long run. Specific policies, planning, and program level interventions in different water conservation practices are discussed to address the study's objective. Also, the role of climate variability on the spatio-temporal deviations in input (water) management of agriculture and domestic use in light of the existing discord between technology and policy is reviewed.","[Pani, Amartya; Mishra, Pulak] Indian Inst Technol, Dept Humanities & Social Sci, Kharagpur 721302, W Bengal, India; [Ghatak, Ishani] Presidency Univ, Dept Geog, Kolkata 700073, W Bengal, India",amartya.geo@gmail.com; ishanighatak.in@gmail.com; pmishra@hss.iitkgp.ac.in,83,0,0,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2363-5037,SUST WAT RESOUR MAN,Sustain.

Forests are the dominant terrestrial biome in Hawai'i, spanning complex, heterogeneous climates across substrates that vary tremendously in age, soil structure, and nutrient availability. Species richness is low in Hawaiian forests compared to other tropical forests, as a consequence of dispersal limitation from continents and adaptive radiations in only some lineages, and forests are dominated by the widespread Metrosideros species complex. Low species richness provides a relatively tractable model system for studies of community assembly, local adaptation, and species interactions. Moreover, Hawaiian forests provide insights into predicted patterns of evolution on islands, revealing that while some evidence supports island syndromes, there are exceptions to them all. For example, Hawaiian plants are not as a whole less defended against herbivores, less dispersible, more conservative in resource use, or more slowgrowing than their continental relatives. Clearly, more work is needed to understand the drivers, sources, and constraints on phenotypic variation among Hawaiian species, including both widespread and rare species, and to understand the role of this variation for ecological and evolutionary processes, which will further contribute to conservation of this unique biota. Today, Hawaiian forests are among the most threatened globally. Resource management failures - the proliferation of non-native species in particular - have led to devastating declines in native taxa and resulted in dominance by novel species assemblages. Conservation and restoration of Hawaiian forests now rely on managing threats including climate change, ongoing species introductions, novel pathogens, lost mutualists, and altered ecosystem dynamics through the use of diverse tools and strategies grounded in basic ecological, evolutionary, and biocultural principles. The future of Hawaiian forests thus depends on the synthesis of ecological and evolutionary research, which will continue to inform future conservation and restoration practices.","[Barton, Kasey E.; Westerband, Andrea; Drake, Donald R.; Feliciano, Kealoha] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Sch Life Sci, 3190 Maile Way,Room 101, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Ostertag, Rebecca] Univ Hawaii, Dept Biol, Hilo, HI 96720 USA; [Stacy, Elizabeth] Univ Nevada, Sch Life Sci, Las Vegas, NV 89154 USA; [Winter, Kawika] Natl Trop Bot Garden, Kauai, HI USA; [Winter, Kawika] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Hawaii Inst Marine Biol, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Winter, Kawika; Litton, Creighton M.] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Nat Resources & Environm Management, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Fortini, Lucas Berio] US Geol Survey, Pacific Isl Ecosyst Res Ctr, Honolulu, HI USA; [Cordell, Susan] US Forest Serv, Inst Pacific Isl Forestry, Hilo, HI USA; [Krushelnycky, Paul] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Plant & Environm Protect Sci, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Kawelo, Kapua] US Army Garrison, Army Nat Resources Program, Schofield Barracks, HI USA; [Bennett, Gordon] Univ Calif, Life & Environm Sci Unit, Merced, CA USA; [Knight, Tiffany] UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Community Ecol, Halle, Saale, Germany; [Knight, Tiffany] Martin Luther Univ Halle Wittenberg, Halle, Saale, Germany; [Knight, Tiffany] German Ctr Integrat Biodivers Res iDiv, Halle Jena Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany; [Westerband, Andrea] Macquarie Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Sydney, NSW, Australia",kbarton@hawaii.edu,508,2,2,ELSEVIER GMBH,MUNICH,"HACKERBRUCKE 6, 80335 MUNICH, GERMANY",1433-8319,PERSPECT PLANT ECOL,Perspect.

Transportation infrastructure, in particular, uniquely affects landscape structure and connectivity. However, spatially explicit, quantitative analyses of change in habitat configuration due to multiple, linked transportation infrastructure are rare. Here, we analyze how a new airport and new highway system altered the spatial pattern of forest habitats to the north of the Istanbul metropolitan region in the context of two-decade-long landscape change. We carry out a land-change analysis from 2000 to 2019. We then analyze the changes in the spatial patterns of various forest habitat types across the metropolitan region, within and in the vicinity of the airport site, and in a key biodiversity area (KBA) that the new highway passes through. New transportation infrastructure significantly altered the forest habitats. Ten percent of all forest cover was lost, a quarter of which due to the new transportation development. Overall and within the KBA, respectively, core forest habitat decreased by 20% and 16%; the share of isolated, highly fragmented, and edge habitats within the remaining forest increased by 7% and 8%. On the European side of the metro area, the last remnants of the connectivity between the western and eastern sections of the forests were lost. The degradation of the forest landscape has implications for the endemic biodiversity and ecosystem services relied on by the metropolitan area. Our findings inform landscape strategies to arrest these degradation trends. Such strategies can succeed if ecological conservation is integrated into planning and current highly centralized governance structure is reformed.","[Guneralp, Burak; Lin, Weiying] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Geog, 797 Lamar St,Eller O&M Bldg, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Xu, Xunwei] Shanghai Ind Dev Res & Appraisal Ctr, Shanghai, Peoples R China",bguneralp@tamu.edu; elsahsu@outlook.com; wlin56@tamu.edu,101,0,0,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1436-3798,REG ENVIRON CHANGE,Reg.

Grassy ecosystems characterize extensive areas in all biomes in Brazil, offering great contribution to biological diversity and providing ecosystem services on which society depends. Palaeoecological evidence indicates these ecosystems evolved under the influence of grazing and fire, and these disturbances have been essential for controlling the dominance of woody vegetation. While the need for fire to maintain grassy biomes has been recently discussed, grazing as a management tool for conservation is still little accepted by the local scientific community and by decision makers. Here we provide a comprehensive analysis of the current literature on grazing management and its effects on grassy ecosystems in Brazil. Based on a review of the role of grazers prior and after European colonization, and a synthesis on grazing effects across different systems, we call for the evaluation of grazing as a management tool for biodiversity conservation in Brazil's grassy systems. Grazing should be an interesting management strategy especially in Legal Reserves with grassy vegetation types, as it can ally conservation with livestock production. To achieve these potentially complementary objectives, a research agenda needs to be developed to devise adaptive management strategies for Legal Reserves. In this, relevant stakeholders should be included and both the ecological conditions of the ecosystem in question and the socioeconomic determinants considered.

It recovers a hitherto unknown history of ecological degradation caused by industrial copper mining during the twentieth century in Chile. It argues that contemporary water wars in Chile, usually viewed as a product of the privatisation of water rights in 1981 and the expansion of foreign investment in the mining sector during the 1990s, combined with the impact of global climate change, have roots in the appropriation of water in Andean rivers by North American companies at the beginning of the twentieth century. The article's thesis is that the Chilean state subsidised the mining industry by granting water rights and turning a blind eye to mining companies' contamination of rivers relied on by agriculturalists for irrigation. Finally, the article traces conservationist responses to the ecological crises produced by contamination of water and soil by the El Teniente mine, which was owned by the Kennecott Copper Company. It demonstrates that conservation of water resources was employed by estate owners as a means of asserting private property rights against the interests of mining companies.","[Klubock, Thomas Miller] Univ Virginia, Corcoran Dept Hist, Charlottesville, VA 22904 USA",tmk5k@virginia.edu,76,0,0,WHITE HORSE PRESS,ISLE OF HARRIS,"1 STROND, ISLE OF HARRIS HS5 3UD, ENGLAND",0967-3407,ENVIRON HIST-UK,Env.

Western spadefoots (Spea hammondii) are small burrowing anurans that breed in ephemeral pools, but adults spend the majority of their lives underground in adjacent terrestrial habitat. Western spadefoots are of conservation concern throughout their range because of habitat loss, but little is known about the activity patterns and ecology of their terrestrial life stage. We conducted a radio-telemetry study of adult western spadefoots at 2 sites in southern California, USA, from December 2018 to November 2019 to characterize their survival, behavior, and movements from breeding through aestivation to refine conservation and management for the species. Western spadefoot survival varied seasonally, with risk of mortality higher in the active season than during aestivation. The probability of movement between successive observations was higher during the winter and spring and when atmospheric moisture was high and soil water content at 10-cm depth was low. The amount of rain between observations had the strongest effect on the probability of movement between observations; for every 20 mm of rainfall between observations, western spadefoots were 2.4 times more likely to move. When movements occurred, movement rates were highest when both relative humidity and soil water content at 10-cm depth were high. The conditions under which western spadefoots were likely active on the surface, likely to have moved, and moved at the highest rates are conditions that reduce the risk of desiccation of surface-active spadefoots. Western spadefoot home range areas varied between study sites and were mostly <1 ha, although 1 individual's home range area was >6 ha. Western spadefoots rapidly dispersed from the breeding pools, and asymptotic distances from the breeding pool were generally reached by June. The asymptotic distance from the breeding pool varied between sites, with the 95th percentile of the posterior predictive distribution reaching 486 m at 1 site and 187 m at the other. Western spadefoots did not select most habitat components disproportionately to their availability, but at Crystal Cove State Park, they avoided most evaluated vegetation types (graminoids, forbs, and shrubs). Spatial variation was evident in most evaluated western spadefoot behaviors; context-dependent behavior suggests that site-specific management is likely necessary for western spadefoots. Furthermore, comparison with an earlier study of western spadefoots at Crystal Cove State Park indicated substantial temporal variation in western spadefoot behavior. Therefore, basing management decisions on short-term studies might fail to meet conservation objectives. Better understanding the influences of spatial context and climatic variation on western spadefoot behavior will improve conservation efforts for this species.

For conservation policies to be cost-effective in the long run these changes need to be taken into account. To some extent, policies can be adapted over time, but transaction costs, lock-in effects and path dependence limit the extent to which such adaptation is possible. Thus it is desirable that conservation policies be designed so that they are cost-effective in the long run even without future adaptations. Given that the future climate change is highly uncertain, the policies need to be robust to climatic uncertainty. In this paper we present an approach for the robustness analysis with regard to the cost-effectiveness of conservation policies in the face of uncertain climate change. The approach is applied to the conservation of a grasshopper species in the German federal state of Schleswig-Holstein. For the assessment of the cost-effectiveness of considered policies we develop a climate-ecological-economic model. We show that in the near future all considered policies have a similar level of robustness, while in the more distant future the policies differ substantially in their robustness and a trade-off emerges between the expected performance and robustness of a policy.","[Drechsler, Martin; Leins, Johannes] UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Ecol Modelling, Permoserstr 15, D-04318 Leipzig, Germany; [Gerling, Charlotte; Sturm, Astrid; Waetzold, Frank] Brandenburg Univ Technol Cottbus Senftenberg, Chair Environm Econ, Erich Weinert Str 1, D-03046 Cottbus, Germany; [Keuler, Klaus] Brandenburg Univ Technol Cottbus Senftenberg, Chair Environm Meteorol, Erich Weinert Str 1, D-03046 Cottbus, Germany",martin.drechsler@ufz.de,51,0,0,ACADEMIC PRESS LTD- ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,LONDON,"24-28 OVAL RD, LONDON NW1 7DX, ENGLAND",0301-4797,J ENVIRON MANAGE,J.

We used interview responses to construct six producer typologies. Most producers had strong positive attitudes toward trees and associated them with a variety of important ecosystem services. Smallholders were more likely to connect trees with provisioning services, while producers on larger farms and with greater agronomic knowledge emphasized regulating services. Most producers connected epiphytes primarily with aesthetic values. Across demographics, producers emphasized the restorative potential for shade coffee in repairing damage to soil, water, and nutrient cycles caused by other forms of agriculture.

The central thesis maintains that the presence of new non-state actors, with ownership of the land and ecosystems, and with philosophical orientations of deep ecology, generates new conditions for environmental conservation and redefines the position of traditional inhabitants, producers linked to family farming. It is critically posited that the new valuation languages operate as a political expression of power and authority, which severely impacts the possibility of reproduction of domestic units, which need ample feeding spaces for their livestock and the native forest for protection. In this way, the traditional space of daily life loses regularity due to the creation of private parks, since they have non-productive purposes and incorporate post-humanist values.

This status of relative preservation is reflected in a number of criteria: The still largely free-flowing nature of many of the rivers and the main stem of the Amazon that feed the delta in sediment, exceptional biodiversity, dominant shoreline accretion, and the absence of anthropogenically-generated subsidence. In this review, we show that these relatively reassuring conditions are progressively being called into question by the effects of dams on fluvial sediment supply to the delta, by increasing demographic, urban, and land development pressures in this still largely underpopulated delta, and by problems of governance that underplay aspects of basin-wide and deltaic environmental deterioration. A major challenge is that of bringing together these contrasting demands that are leading to the emergence of zones of environmental stress that test the resilience of this delta. An integral part of the strategy for the analysis of collective action, management, and conservation is that of considering the Amazon delta in terms of interacting socio-ecological systems. Pressures on the delta will be compounded in the future by decreasing fluvial sediment supply and sea-level rise. Although climate change is projected to generate surplus sediment, the rapid growth of dam constructions upstream of the delta will negatively impact the river's sediment flux. Conservation and management of the Amazon River system aimed at keeping the delta resilient in the context of sea-level rise and reduction of sediment supply will require clear governance and better planning and anticipation, as well as socio-ecological integration. These are also requirements that will need to be implemented in the 1500 km-long coastal zone of the Guianas countries located west of the Amazon delta and the sediment dynamics and stability of which are largely determined by sediment supply from the Amazon.","[Anthony, Edward J.] Aix Marseille Univ, CEREGE, F-13545 Aix En Provence, France; [Brondizio, Eduardo S.] Indiana Univ, Dept Anthropol, 701 E Kirkwood Ave, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Brondizio, Eduardo S.] Indiana Univ, Ctr Anal Social Ecol Landscapes, 701 E Kirkwood Ave, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [dos Santos, Valdenira F.] IEPA, NuPAq, BR-68903372 Macapa, Brazil; [Gardel, Antoine] Univ Guyane, IFREMER, CNRS, USR LEEISA, F-97334 Cayenne, France; [Besset, Manon] Bordeaux Technowest, I Sea, 25 Rue Marcel Issartier, F-33700 Merignac, France",anthony@cerege.fr; ebrondiz@indiana.edu; valdeniraferreira@gmail.com; antoine.gardel@cnrs.fr; manon.besset@i-sea.fr,113,1,1,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,WATER-SUI,Water,2021,"Green Published, gold",

Thus, there is an increasing need for conservation geneticists to continually learn and train to stay up-to-date through avenues such as symposia, meetings, and workshops. The ConGen meeting is a near-annual workshop that strives to guide participants in understanding population genetics principles, study design, data processing, analysis, interpretation, and applications to real-world conservation issues. Each year of ConGen gathers a diverse set of instructors, students, and resulting lectures, hands-on sessions, and discussions. Here, we summarize key lessons learned from the 2019 meeting and more recent updates to the field with a focus on big data in conservation genomics. First, we highlight classical and contemporary issues in study design that are especially relevant to working with big datasets, including the intricacies of data filtering. We next emphasize the importance of building analytical skills and simulating data, and how these skills have applications within and outside of conservation genetics careers. We also highlight recent technological advances and novel applications to conservation of wild populations. Finally, we provide data and recommendations to support ongoing efforts by ConGen organizers and instructors-and beyond-to increase participation of underrepresented minorities in conservation and eco-evolutionary sciences. The future success of conservation genetics requires both continual training in handling big data and a diverse group of people and approaches to tackle key issues, including the global bio-diversityloss crisis.","[Schweizer, Rena M.; Hand, Brian K.; Luikart, Gordon] Univ Montana, Div Biol Sci, 32 Campus Dr, Missoula, MT 59812 USA; [Saarman, Norah] Utah State Univ, Dept Biol, Logan, UT 84322 USA; [Ramstad, Kristina M.] Univ South Carolina, Dept Biol & Geol, Aiken, SC USA; [Forester, Brenna R.] Colorado State Univ, Dept Biol, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Kelley, Joanna L.] Washington State Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Pullman, WA USA; [Hand, Brian K.; Malison, Rachel L.; Luikart, Gordon] Univ Montana, Flathead Lake Biol Stn, Poison, MT USA; [Ackiss, Amanda S.] Univ Wisconsin, Wisconsin Cooperat Fishery Res Unit, Stevens Point, WI 54481 USA; [Watsa, Mrinalini] San Diego Zoo Global, Escondido, CA USA; [Nelson, Thomas C.] Embark Vet Inc, Boston, MA USA; [Beja-Pereira, Albano] Univ Porto, Ctr Invest Biodiversidade & Recursos Genet CIBIO, InBIO, Vairgo, Portugal; [Beja-Pereira, Albano] Univ Porto, Fac Sci, DGAOT, Porto, Portugal; [Beja-Pereira, Albano] Univ Porto, Fac Sci, Sustainable Agrifood Prod Res Ctr GreenUPorto, Porto, Portugal; [Waples, Robin S.] NOAA Fisheries, Northwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, Seattle, WA USA; [Funk, W.

As the post-2020 global biodiversity framework is negotiated, it is essential that we learn lessons from past failures. Here, we investigate whether a reduction in extinction risk could realistically be achieved within the ten-year timeframe of the Aichi Targets. We identified threatened bird and mammal species for which a population increase could lead to down-listing on the IUCN Red List and created population models that assumed exponential population growth to predict how long it would take to reach the population size threshold required for down-listing. We found that in the best-case scenario, 39/42 birds (93%) and 12/15 mammals (80%) could be expected to show the population increase required to achieve down-listing by one Red List category within a ten-year timeframe. In contrast, under the worst-case scenario, 67% birds and 40% mammals were predicted to take > 10 years to reach the population threshold. These results indicate a disparity between the ecological timeframes required for species to show a reduction in extinction risk, and the political timeframes over which such ecological change is expected to be achieved and detected. We suggest that quantitative analyses should be used to set realistic milestone targets in the post-2020 framework, and that global indicators should be supplemented with temporally sensitive measures of conservation progress in order to maintain political and societal motivation for species conservation.","[Piipponen-Doyle, Stella; Bolam, Friederike C.; Mair, Louise] Newcastle Univ, Sch Nat & Environm Sci, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England",louise.mair@newcastle.ac.uk,41,1,1,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0960-3115,BIODIVERS CONSERV,Biodivers.

Yet the adequacy of protected area systems in many tropical nations is poorly understood, and assessments are usually focused on vertebrates. Here, we model the occurrence of 246 butterfly species, and determine the extent to which they occur in protected areas in Bangladesh, a country that forms part of the Indo-Burma biodiversity hotspot. We develop ecological niche models, and measure overlap with protected areas using three methods to map species distributions (habitat suitability, area of occupancy, and extent of occurrence). Suitability maps identify the north-east and south-east regions as the main centres of butterfly diversity, yet there is marked variation among families, and between non-threatened and threatened species. Using the suitability map approach, a mean of 1.27% of the geographic range of species is covered by protected areas. Only two species (Euploea crameri and Danaus melanippus) have >15% coverage, 25% of species have no coverage and 70% of species have <1% coverage. Overall, protected area coverage is slightly higher for threatened species. Tracts of suitable, but unprotected habitat still exist in the north-east and south-east regions of Bangladesh, and designation of new protected areas in these regions will strengthen butterfly conservation in the country. Enhanced management of existing protected areas, and a strategy for conserving butterflies and other insects outside protected areas will also help secure the long-term future for biodiversity in Bangladesh.

The majority of these studies analyze dry stone terraces and their influence on soil erosion and water runoff, either in cultivated or abandoned terrace systems. Only a minority of papers suggest maintenance or conservation strategies or involve farmers, exploring their decision-making.

Taking Nanjing as a case study, we divided the territory into ecological and non-ecological redline areas (ERAs and NERAs, respectively). This paper highlights two key research issues based on the 2005, 2010, 2015 and 2018 annual remote sensing data: (i) quantitative analysis of the Ecological Redline Policy (ERP) validity by conducting a horizontal comparison of the ERAs and NERAs; and (ii) exploration of the land-use transitions and spatial pattern changes affecting ecosystem service value (ESV). Results showed that delineating ECRL could effectively slow down the decline rate of ESV. The trend of eco-quality deterioration was greater than eco-quality improvement in Nanjing, presenting an ESV that declined slightly in the whole. According to our findings, we suggest that reasonably increasing eco-lands (woodland and water area) and decreasing construction land will enhance the regional ESV. Meanwhile, promoting the transition from production space to ecological space and depressing the encroachment of living space on other space types, will be instrumental in mitigating the ESV decline. The results of this study are expected to provide valuable implications for spatial planning and sustainable development in Nanjing.","[Yang, Minghui; Xie, Yu] Nanjing Forestry Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Nanjing 210037, Peoples R China; [Xie, Yu] NFU Acad Chinese Ecol Progress & Forestry Dev Stu, Nanjing 210037, Peoples R China",ymh1730256@163.com; xieyu@njfu.edu.cn,52,4,4,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,INT J ENV RES PUB HE,Int.

The present paper, broadly grounded in political ecology, explores how social justice tenets are used to frame and implement anti-poaching initiatives in Sub-Saharan Africa. In particular, the study examines the Akashinga model, a Zimbabwean woman-only anti-poaching initiative founded by the Australian conservation activist, Damien Mander. Political ecology lends itself well to the analysis of social justice initiatives as it unpacks how political, economic and social factors interact with environmental issues and changes. Akashinga is particularly compelling as a socially innovative conservation model intended to replace hunting tourism in Sub-Saharan wilderness areas. Data were collected from a rich selection of online sources, including social media and relevant websites. Our analysis reveals Akashinga's framing and modus operandi as premised three dimensions: community involvement, the empowerment of women, and the superiority of women in achieving anti-poaching success and broader conservation outcomes. It is argued that, while Akashinga makes a positive contribution to the local community and wildlife conservation efforts, there are important caveats to consider, in the context of postcolonial power relations.","[Mkono, Mucha; Ruhanen, Lisa] Univ Queensland, UQ Business Sch, Tourism, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Rastegar, Raymond] Univ Queensland, UQ Business Sch, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Ruhanen, Lisa] Univ Queensland, UQ Business Sch, Educ, Brisbane, Qld, Australia",m.mkono@uq.edu.au,92,0,0,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-9582,J SUSTAIN TOUR,J.

Local management schemes can help improve the condition of coral reefs by enhancing their ecosystem recovery capacity. Caribbean conservation efforts include mitigation of local anthropogenic stressors, and integrating social participation. Here, we analyzed the case of the Bayahibe reefs in the Southeastern (SE) Dominican Republic to identify conservation actions and illustrate a conceptual example of local seascape management. We assessed reef health indicators from 2011 to 2016. Overall, our results show increases in total fish biomass, in both commercial and herbivorous fishes. Mean live coral cover was 31% and fleshy macroalgae was 23% after multiple disturbances such as Hurricanes Sandy and Isaac (2012), Mathew (2016) and heat stress presented in the study area in 2015. We also described actions taken by stakeholders and government institutions, including the implementation of a policy declaring an area of 869,000 ha as a marine protected area (MPA), enhanced water quality treatment, local restrictions to vessel traffic, enforcement of fishing regulations, and the removal of invasive lionfish (Pterois spp.). In addition, a restoration program for the threatened staghorn coral (Acropora cervicornis) was established in 2011, and currently has eight coral nurseries and six outplanting sites. Considering the biology and ecology of these reefs, we observed good results for these indicators (live coral cover, fish biomass, and water quality) in contrast with severely degraded Caribbean reefs, suggesting that optimizing local management may be a useful example for improving reef condition. Our results provide an overview of trends in reef condition in the SE Dominican Republic and could support current strategies to better protect reefs in the region. Given that Caribbean coral reefs face extreme challenges from global climate change, management measures may improve reef conditions across the region but stronger policy processes and increased scientific knowledge are needed for the successful management of coral reefs.","[Cortes-Useche, Camilo; Calle-Trivino, Johanna; Arias-Gonzalez, Jesus E.] Ctr Invest & Estudios Avanzados IPN, Dept Recursos Mar, Merida, Yucatan, Mexico; [Cortes-Useche, Camilo; Calle-Trivino, Johanna; Galvan, Victor] Iberostar Hotels & Resorts, Wave Change, Playa Paraiso, Quintana Roo, Mexico; [Hernandez-Delgado, Edwin A.] Univ Puerto Rico, Dept Environm Sci, San Juan, PR 00936 USA; [Hernandez-Delgado, Edwin A.] Univ Puerto Rico, Ctr Appl Trop Ecol & Conservat, San Juan, PR 00936 USA; [Hernandez-Delgado, Edwin A.] Soc Ambiente Marino, San Juan, PR USA; [Sellares Blasco, Rita] Fdn Dominicana Estudios Marinos, Bayahibe, La Altagracia, Dominican Rep",camilo.cortes@cinvestav.mx,95,2,2,PEERJ INC,LONDON,"341-345 OLD ST, THIRD FLR, LONDON, EC1V 9LL, ENGLAND",2167-8359,PEERJ,PeerJ,2021,"Green Published, gold",

The dilemma is here examined via a case study, that of a proposed natural gas installation at James Price Point in the far north of Western Australia.

We reviewed 2,167 camera trap (CT) articles from 1994 to 2020. Through the lens of technological diffusion, we assessed trends in: (1) CT adoption measured by published research output, (2) topic, taxonomic, and geographic diversification and composition of CT applications, and (3) sampling effort, spatial extent, and temporal duration of CT studies. Annual publications of CT articles have grown 81-fold since 1994, increasing at a rate of 1.26 (SE = 0.068) per year since 2005, but with decelerating growth since 2017. Topic, taxonomic, and geographic richness of CT studies increased to encompass 100% of topics, 59.4% of ecoregions, and 6.4% of terrestrial vertebrates. However, declines in per article rates of accretion and plateaus in Shannon's H for topics and major taxa studied suggest upper limits to further diversification of CT research as currently practiced. Notable compositional changes of topics included a decrease in capture-recapture, recent decrease in spatial-capture-recapture, and increases in occupancy, interspecific interactions, and automated image classification. Mammals were the dominant taxon studied; within mammalian orders carnivores exhibited a unimodal peak whereas primates, rodents and lagomorphs steadily increased. Among biogeographic realms we observed decreases in Oceania and Nearctic, increases in Afrotropic and Palearctic, and unimodal peaks for Indomalayan and Neotropic. Camera days, temporal extent, and area sampled increased, with much greater rates for the 0.90 quantile of CT studies compared to the median. Next-generation CT studies are poised to expand knowledge valuable to wildlife ecology and conservation by posing previously infeasible questions at unprecedented spatiotemporal scales, on a greater array of species, and in a wider variety of environments. Converting potential into broad-based application will require transferable models of automated image classification, and data sharing among users across multiple platforms in a coordinated manner. Further taxonomic diversification likely will require technological modifications that permit more efficient sampling of smaller species and adoption of recent improvements in modeling of unmarked populations. Environmental diversification can benefit from engineering solutions that expand ease of CT sampling in traditionally challenging sites.","[Delisle, Zackary J.; Flaherty, Elizabeth A.; Nobbe, Mackenzie R.; Wzientek, Cole M.; Swihart, Robert K.] Purdue Univ, Dept Forestry & Nat Resources, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA",zdelisle@purdue.edu,115,4,4,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",2296-701X,FRONT ECOL EVOL,Front.

Previous systematic studies had established that the genus encompasses nine species although no phylogenetic molecular studies are available in which all the taxa have been included. The American continent has the largest number of species, encouraging research into how these taxa have evolved. Here we present a phylogenetic analysis based on three plastids (ndhF, trnL-F, and atpB-rbcL) and one nuclear (ITS) marker that cover the most extensive geographic distribution of the genus. We use this phylogeny to test the monophyly of Imperata within tribe Andropogoneae, analyze the infrageneric relationships of the genus, and estimate lineage divergence time. Additionally, ecological niche models (ENM) of the American lineages are presented to recognize the abiotic factors that constraint their potential geographic distribution and allow an understanding of the ecological drivers for species diversification. Our results yield a fully supported tree where monophyly is confirmed for the genus and exposes the existence of two clades, one encompassing five American lineages and the other encompassing those of the rest of the world. In parallel, molecular dating, ENM, and ecological speciation tests suggest that American lineages underwent speciation during the Quaternary associated with conservatism and niche divergence.

For the first time, size and aspect of trees, and their community association were contrasted between the species. Genotyping confirmed that T. platyphyllos, T. cordata and their hybrid (T. x europaea) were present in the BFNP and both species deserve conservation. T. platyphyllos has a higher genetic diversity for both sets of markers than T. cordata, confirming earlier work. Both species showed genetic diversity comparable to other populations in Central Europe, which is likely to be sufficient for the maintenance of the species in the short term. However, increasing the number of trees, ensuring local sources are used, and gene flow from surrounding forests over the next decennia may be crucial for longterm survival. Further, within the T. platyphyllos group there was a set of 11 trees that were distinct from the others: they had a lower genetic diversity and were shorter. We hypothesise that these were planted and should not be used for propagation and augmentation. Most saplings analysed appeared to derive from asexual propagation (36 out of 41), although a few (five out of 41) were novel genotypes. This means that, currently, there is some, but rather limited, regeneration. T. cordata was found at a lower altitude and less steep terrain than T. platyphyllos and the hybrid. The hybrid was taller than the two species, while the diameter at breast height was smallest in T. cordata. T. cordata shows a preference for mixed and coniferous forests, while T. platyphyllos occurs mostly in deciduous forests. Our results indicate that biodiversity at the species and genetic level as well as species' ecology have to be considered in order to guide informed conservation management. These results form the basis to recommend conservation management improving the long-term viability of Tilia in the BFNP and other mixed forests.","[Wolff, Kirsten; Logan, Samuel A.] Newcastle Univ, Sch Nat & Environm Sci, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England; [Depner, Bernhard; Heurich, Marco] Univ Freiburg, Chair Wildlife Ecol & Management, Dept Visitor Management & Natl Pk Monitoring, Bavarian Forest Natl Pk, Freiburg, Germany; [Depner, Bernhard] Tech Univ Munich, Wissensch Zentrum Weihenstephan, Lehrstuhl Waldwachstumskunde, Hans Carl von Carlowitz Pl 2, D-85354 Freising Weihenstephan, Germany",kirstenwolff53@gmail.com; bernhard.depner@tum.de; samuel.logan@ncl.ac.uk; marco.Heurich@npv-bw.bayern.de,80,1,1,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0378-1127,FOREST ECOL MANAG,For.

We conducted seven fieldtrips across three years of dry seasons. For the capture-mark-recapture method, a 400 m long stream inside Passa Tres cave, where I. passensis occurs and a 300 m long reach of an upper tributary where I. bambui occurs inside Angelica cave were divided into 20 and 17 study sections, respectively. Catfishes were hand-netted, measured (standard length), weighed, marked by subcutaneous injection of biocompatible pigments, and released. The four species show medium-to-low mean population densities (0.03 ind/m(2) 0.7 ind/m(2)). Capture-mark-recapture data pointed to a relatively small population size for I. passensis, restricted to a 1600 m long stream inside Passa Tres cave (N = 719) and for I. bambui (N = 246; 300 m of epikarstic drainage). Ituglanis passensis and I. bambui move along relatively small areas with a restricted home range. We observed recruitment patterns and a trend of decrease in condition factor during the dry seasons for I. bambui but not for I. passensis, suggesting that epikarstic waters are probably more limiting concerning food input. Ituglanis passensis and I. bambui showed low growth and consequently high longevity, corroborated by captivity data (20 years).

However, restricting research to public land and omitting private land, as commonly occurs in ecological research, can bias inferences because important drivers of population and community patterns may vary with land ownership. We conducted a landscape-scale study of a species of conservation concern, white-tailed prairie dog (WTPD; Cynomys leucurus), across multiple land ownerships in Wyoming. We quantified how WTPD occupancy varied with both land ownership and biotic and abiotic factors. We established a baseline occupancy rate for WTPD in Wyoming, and quantified how this baseline would have been biased if we had restricted our study to public land. We surveyed 440 sites throughout the Wyoming range of WTPD, which included sites on public (275), private (80), checkerboard (55), and Wind River Indian Reservation (30) land. We found that WTPD occupancy varied significantly with land ownership and elevation, with WTPD being four times as likely to occupy private as public land at the median study area elevation. This difference in occupancy may have been driven by variation in habitat quality between ownership types, but we could not definitively determine the underlying cause. Regardless of land ownership, WTPD occupancy increased with bare ground, but also when recent plant biomass (as estimated by NDVI) was higher than a site's long-term average biomass. In other words, WTPD tended to occupy sparsely vegetated sites, but occupancy increased with short-term increases in biomass. The strong land ownership effect illustrates how study area delineation in relation to land ownership can influence research inferences and management actions, and why it is counterproductive to presuppose that certain land ownerships contain low-quality habitat. Ecologically, the variation in occupancy resulting from long-term site conditions, such as overall density of vegetation, relative to short-term site conditions, such as changes in plant biomass, can be used to improve long-term population monitoring for WTPD.","[Ceradini, Joseph] Utah Valley Univ, Capitol Reef Field Stn, Orem, UT 84058 USA; [Ceradini, Joseph] Utah Valley Univ, Dept Biol, Orem, UT 84058 USA; [Keinath, Douglas] US Fish & Wildlife Serv, Wyoming Ecol Serv Field Off, Cheyenne, WY 82009 USA; [Abernethy, Ian; Andersen, Mark; Wallace, Zach] Univ Wyoming, Wyoming Nat Divers Database, Laramie, WY 82071 USA",JCeradini@uvu.edu,72,1,1,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2150-8925,ECOSPHERE,Ecosphere,2021,gold,

Mandating ecosystem-level protection in policy and legislative frameworks is essential to prevent biodiversity loss. Australia's Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 is the key legislative mechanism for supporting biodiversity at the national level, but has so far been ineffective at protecting habitat and ecological communities. Here we identify a major flaw in the current approach to listing threatened ecological communities (TECs): restrictive condition thresholds that threaten ecosystem function in dynamic ecosystems. Using two wetland TECs as a case study (Upland Wetlands and Coolibah-Black Box Woodlands), we argue that Australia's environmental legislation should adopt a landscape-scale approach to TEC protection that acknowledges ecosystem function, accounts for different states in temporally dynamic systems, and sustains landscape connectivity of TEC distribution. We present a state-and-transition model for each TEC to show how human activities affect the reference-state continuum of wet and dry phases. We also show that the current listed condition thresholds do not acknowledge alternative ecosystem states and exclude areas that may be important for restoration and conservation of the TEC at the landscape-scale. Description of alternative and transitional states for dynamic systems, including how, when and why ecological communities shift between different states, should be formally integrated into the TEC listing process to protect Australia's vulnerable ecosystems from further degradation and loss.","[Saunders, Manu E.; Bower, Deborah S.; Mika, Sarah; Hunter, John T.] Univ New England, Sch Environm & Rural Sci, Ecosyst Management, Armidale, NSW 2351, Australia",manu.saunders@une.edu.au,88,6,6,CSIRO PUBLISHING,CLAYTON,"UNIPARK, BLDG 1, LEVEL 1, 195 WELLINGTON RD, LOCKED BAG 10, CLAYTON, VIC 3168, AUSTRALIA",1038-2097,PAC CONSERV BIOL,Pac.

Yet, what determines ecological uniqueness has rarely been examined. Here, we investigated the determinants of ecological uniqueness in species assemblages in forest communities. Location China. Methods We used tree census data, combined with spatially explicit environmental variables collected from forest dynamics plots across tropical, subtropical and temperate forests in China. We computed beta diversity as the total variation of the community data, and a site-based approach was used to determine whether ecological uniqueness is related to local environmental conditions and/or community characteristics. Results Ecological uniqueness was explained by both local environment and community characteristics, but their relative importance varied across the four forest types. We provide direct evidence that the relationship between ecological uniqueness and species richness (EUSRR) is related to the percentage of rare species in the community. Local environmental factors affecting ecological uniqueness and beta diversity were inconsistent, indicating that focusing simultaneously on beta diversity and ecological uniqueness with regard to local environmental conditions is likely to be the appropriate approach to study forest community assembly. Main conclusions Although the EUSRR was negative in some cases, indicating high species richness, this does not necessarily imply high ecological uniqueness. Thus, for biological conservation, species-rich sites and unique low-richness sites should be valued more. The higher degree of ecological uniqueness indicates unique species compositions, which provides insight into finding such quadrats and taking measures for protection, restoration or management. We propose that focusing simultaneously on the beta diversity, species richness and ecological uniqueness of individual quadrats is likely to be a valuable approach for biodiversity conservation programmes.","[Yao, Jie; Huang, Jihong; Ding, Yi; Xu, Yue; Zang, Runguo] Chinese Acad Forestry, Res Inst Forest Ecol Environm & Protect, Key Lab Forest Ecol & Environm, State Forestry & Grassland Adm, Beijing 100091, Peoples R China; [Yao, Jie; Huang, Jihong; Ding, Yi; Xu, Yue; Zang, Runguo] Nanjing Forestry Univ, Coinnovat Ctr Sustainable Forestry Southern China, Nanjing, Peoples R China; [Xu, Han] Chinese Acad Forestry, Res Inst Trop Forestry, Guangzhou, Peoples R China",zangrung@caf.ac.cn,40,5,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1366-9516,DIVERS DISTRIB,Divers.

In order to make rational decisions for land-use planning that is grounded in a systematic understanding of trade-offs between different land-use strategies, it is very important to understand the response mechanisms of various ecosystem services to changes in land-use. Therefore, the objective of our study is to assess the effects of land-use change on six ecosystem services and their trade-offs among the ecosystem services in the ecological conservation area (ECA) in Beijing, China. To do this, we projected future land-use in 2030 under three different scenarios: Business as Usual (BAU), Ecological Protection (ELP), and Rapid Urban Development (RUD), using GeoSOS-FLUS model. Then, we quantified six ecosystem services (carbon storage, soil conservation, water purification, habitat quality, flood regulation, and food production) in response to land-use changes from 2015 to 2030, using a spatially explicit InVEST model. Finally, we illustrated the trade-offs and/or synergistic relationships between each ecosystem service quantified under each of the different scenarios in 2030. Results showed that built-up land is projected to increase by 281.18 km(2) at the cost of water bodies and cultivated land from 2015 to 2030 under the RUD scenario, while forest land is projected to increase by 152.38 km(2) under the ELP scenario. The carbon storage, soil conservation, habitat quality, and the sum of ecosystem services (SES) would enrich the highest level under the ELP scenario.

However, few studies have explored how to develop the optimal floodwater and groundwater regulation strategies that take into account both ecological water supply and vegetation growth. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to propose the suitable regulation strategies by revealing that the plant growth responses to hydrological variation (i.e., the flooding and groundwater depth). Based on two growth indicators (i.e., the time-integrated normalized difference vegetation index (TINDVI) for plant canopy growth and the tree-ring chronology for trunk growth) in the middle reaches of the Tarim River, and water consumption, water discharge from ecological sluices for flooding, and groundwater depth data, after the implementation of an scheme in ecological water conservancy engineering, the ecological water transport efficiency, tree-ring chronology in Populus euphratica, and TINDVI improved by 12.4%, 5.6% and 4.2%, respectively. Notably, the tree-ring chronology increased with a decrease in water consumption. Due to a significant correlation between tree-ring chronology and TINDVI, the tree-ring chronology could be used to reconstruct the canopy growth in the case of the unavailability of monitoring data. There were significant correlations between TINDVI and groundwater depth in June-October, between tree-ring chronology and groundwater depth in October, and between water discharge from ecological sluices and vegetation growth in September. In addition, there were high correlation and sensitivity between trunk growth and water discharge (compared to groundwater depth), and between canopy growth and groundwater depth (compared to water discharge). Based on the above results, potentially sustainable groundwater depths (-2.3 to -3.7 m) and discharge water quantities (3.53-5.90 x 10(8) m(3)) and regimes were proposed that could further promote the vegetation growth.","[Ling, Hongbo; Yan, Junjie; Xu, Hailiang; Zhang, Guangpeng] Chinese Acad Sci, Xinjiang Inst Ecol & Geog, State Key Lab Desert & Oasis Ecol, Urumqi 830011, Peoples R China; [Ling, Hongbo; Yan, Junjie; Xu, Hailiang; Zhang, Guangpeng] Akesu Natl Stn Observat & Res Oasis Agro ecosyst, Akesu 843017, Xinjiang, Peoples R China; [Ling, Hongbo; Yan, Junjie; Xu, Hailiang; Zhang, Guangpeng] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Guo, Bin] Shandong Univ Sci & Technol, Coll Geomat, Qingdao 266510, Peoples R China; [Deng, Xiaoya] China Inst Water Resources & Hydropower Res, Dept Water Resources, State Key Lab Simulat & Regulat Water Cycle River, Beijing 100038, Peoples R China",hufengxia0622@163.com; linghongbo0929@163.com,73,9,10,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1470-160X,ECOL INDIC,Ecol.

The objective of this study was to review known species distribution and propose potential and conservation status for Salvia species in Michoacan sState using Ecological Niche Models (ENM). We reviewed taxonomic studies for Salvia in Michoacan to compile an initial species checklist, built upon with recently-described species; all the specimens deposited in the National Herbarium were reviewed. The collection data allowed us to build niche models of Salvia species reported for Michoacan. ENM were generated for the species listed using Maxent. In order to minimise collinearity, environmental variables were selected using a Pearson correlation test. Individual models were statistically evaluated and the potential distribution models for each individual species were stacked to obtain the map of richness potential distribution in the State. A total of 66 species of Salvia are listed for Michoacan; however, ENM could only be constructed for 42 of those with >= 5 specimens. The environmental variable that most strongly contributed to the models was annual average temperature. The models estimated that Salvia species occupy an area of 23,541 km(2) in the State, 72% in the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt and a second richest ecoregion is the Sierra Madre del Sur. Although only 3% of the potential distribution area for Salvia in Michoacan is within Protected Areas (PAs), nonetheless, no PA includes rare species. It will therefore be necessary to consider new protection areas or expand existing ones in order to adequately conserve Salvia richness and rarity in the State.","[Flores-Tolentino, Mayra; Luis Villasenor, Jose] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Mexico City, DF, Mexico; [Lara-Cabrera, Sabina I.] Univ Michoacana, Morelia, Michoacan, Mexico",vrios@ib.unam.mx,74,0,0,PENSOFT PUBLISHERS,SOFIA,"12 PROF GEORGI ZLATARSKI ST, SOFIA, 1700, BULGARIA",1314-2836,BIODIVERS DATA J,Biodiver.

However, a third possibility is that species survive in stable ecological refuges that then supply the surrounding matrix with immigrants. In this study, we examined the potential for refuge-colonisation dynamics across two Key Biodiversity Areas dominated by commercial farmland in South Africa. We combined six years of remote sensing and two years of field surveys to examine mountains and rocky outcrops as ecological refuges using butterflies as indicators of environmental change. Vegetation on mountains and outcrops had higher and less variable productivity and moisture retention than the matrix, even across exceptionally wet and dry years. Moreover, butterflies in the matrix were a nested subset of species from the mountains and outcrops, and there was little evidence that species with certain traits were limited to either habitat. This suggests that species can retreat to ecological refuges during harsh conditions and recolonise the surrounding matrix once conditions improve. Ecological refuges can, therefore, unify land-sharing and land-sparing because their targeted protection would support the persistence of species throughout wider landscapes.","[Buschke, Falko T.; Pinceel, Tom; Mehlomakhulu, Zimkhitha; du Randt, Lischen; Vanschoenwinkel, Bram] Univ Free State, Ctr Environm Management IB 67, POB 339, ZA-9300 Bloemfontein, South Africa; [Buschke, Falko T.; Pinceel, Tom] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Anim Ecol Global Change & Sustainable Dev, Charles Deberiotstr 32, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium; [Coetzer, Carina] BirdLife South Africa, Landscape Conservat Programme, 17 Hume Rd, ZA-2196 Johannesburg, South Africa; [Moreels, Nele; Vanschoenwinkel, Bram] Vrije Univ Brussel VUB, Dept Biol, Community Ecol Lab, Pl Laan 2, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium",falko.buschke@gmail.com,80,2,2,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0006-3207,BIOL CONSERV,Biol.

However, its populations are in rapid decline due to human pressure and environmental degradation. As a consequence, the species is now considered being endangered, demanding an urgent conservation intervention to sustain its existence. This study was carried out in the Abergele district, northern Ethiopia,with objectives to characterize the current population structure of B. papyrifera and prioritize its potential conservation intervention alternatives using Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) modelling techniques. The woody species related data were collected from 33 sample plots randomly established in the study area. Data related to the potential intervention alternatives and their evaluating criteria were collected from experts, personal experiences and intensive literature reviews, and then validated using stakeholders' focus group discussion. Four candidate alternatives were then considered for the AHP: 1) free grazing with no tapping resting period (FGNTR), 2) free grazing with a rotational tapping (FGRT), 3) area exclosure with medium tapping resting period (AEMTR), and 4) area exclosure with long tapping resting period (AELTR). The results showed that the population structure of B. papyrifera is unstable and is characterized by low density (266 trees ha(-1)), absence of regeneration and saplings (DBH <10 cm) due to different interrelated disturbances such as overgrazing, over tapping, pests, agricultural expansion and poor managements. The overall priority ranking value of all stakeholders using the AHP techniques also indicated that AEMTR (with overall rank value of 0.352) and AELTR (0.294) as the best alternatives strategies, respectively, for sustainable B. papyrifera woodland conservation. For the success of the sestrategies, their economic impacts at their early implementation stages (5-10 years) should be minimized by collecting different non-timber forest products from the woodland. Continuous capacity building training on sustainable utilizations and managements of B. papyrifera woodland should also be provided for all relevant stakeholders.","[Gidey, Tesfay] Univ Adigrat, Coll Agr & Environm Sci, Dept Plant Sci, POB 50, Adigrat, Ethiopia; [Hagos, Daniel] Univ Adigrat, Coll Agr & Environm Sci, Dept Nat Resources Management, POB 50, Adigrat, Ethiopia; [Juhar, Hagos Mohammedseid] Mekelle Univ, Dept Biotechnol, POB 231, Mekelle, Ethiopia; [Solomon, Negasi] Mekelle Univ, Dept Land Resources Management & Environm Protect, POB 231, Mekelle, Ethiopia; [Negussie, Aklilu] WeForest, Ogentroostlaan 15, B-3090 Overijse, Belgium; [Crous-Duran, Josep; Palma, Joao H.

This is also the case in the Mediterranean Sea, which is considered an extinction hotspot for rays and sharks. The central position of the Italian peninsula makes it an ideal location for studying the status and changes of this sea. There is a lack of biological, ecological and historical data when assessing shark populations, which is also highlighted in the Red List of Threatened Species compiled by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Historical data can provide important information to better understand how chondrichthyan populations have changed over time. This study aims to provide a clearer understanding of the changes in distribution and abundance of eight shark species in the Italian seas that are currently classified as at risk of extinction by the IUCN. In this respect, a bibliographic review was conducted on items from the 19th century to the first half of the 20th century, focusing on the selected species. The results show that all sharks were considered common until the beginning of the 20th century but have declined since, with a clear negative trend, mainly in the past 70 years. The strong local decline has been attributed to overexploitation, bycatch, habitat loss, depletion of prey items and environmental pollution. Furthermore, historical data also allow us to avoid the issue of a 'shifting baseline', in which contemporary abundances are assumed to be normal. Using historical data to further our knowledge of the marine environment is becoming increasingly common, and is fundamental in understanding human impact and evaluating mitigation measures to manage and conserve marine species and environments.","[Leonetti, Francesco Luigi; Sperone, Emilio] Univ Calabria, Dept Biol Ecol & Earth Sci DiBEST, I-87036 Arcavacata Di Rende, CS, Italy; [Leonetti, Francesco Luigi; Dinkel, Thaya M.; Bottaro, Massimiliano] Italian Natl Inst Marine Biol Ecol & Biotechnol, Stn Zool Anton Dohrn, Dept Integrat Marine Ecol EMI, I-80121 Naples, Italy; [Travaglini, Andrea; Signore, Marco] Italian Natl Inst Marine Biol Ecol & Biotechnol, Stn Zool Anton Dohrn, Darwin Dohrn Museum DaDoM, I-80121 Naples, Italy; [Mojetta, Angelo R.] Inst Marine Studies ISM, Aquarium & Civ Hydrobiol Stn Milan, Viale Gadio, I-20121 Milan, Italy; [Psomadakis, Peter N.] Food & Agr Org United Nat FAO, Viale Terme di Caracalla, I-00153 Rome, Italy",francescoluigi.leonetti@szn.it; emilio.sperone@unical.it; andrea.travaglini@szn.it; amojetta@tin.it; marco.signore@szn.it; peter.psomadakis@gmail.com; thaya.dinkel@szn.it; massimiliano.bottaro@szn.it,113,4,4,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,DIVERSITY-BASEL,Diversity-Basel,2020,gold,

Discussing the Conservative Laestadian Desire to Mother within Reproductive Justice,GENEALOGY,the Conservative Laestadian women; motherhood; desire to mother; procreational ethos; reproductive justice; ecological response-ability,,"This article discusses the Conservative Laestadian women's desire to mother and the procreational ethos of the Conservative Laestadian religious movement in the framework of reproductive justice and ecological crisis. The data draws from my doctoral study in which I examined the aspirations of women who belonged in the Conservative Laestadian religious revival movement in Finland. In my attempt to understand the Laestadian women's desire to mother within the procreational ethos of this conservative religion, and to form an alternative approach to the issue in feminist ethico-ecological framework, I employ Donna J. Haraway's concept of response-ability together with Bracha L. Ettinger's theory of matrixial feminine transconnectivity. With this article, I propose that in their multivocality, diversity, and intertwined nature, the Laestadian women's accounts of motherhood assist in understanding the many aspirations, intentions, agencies, and a ffects that operate within the desire to mother in this conservative religious movement. The Laestadian women's diverging accounts enable us to consider motherhood as a manifold issue for a pious woman: a natural duty and an obligation, but also a position through which to claim the status of a subject. This invites us to think of the Laestadian women's desire to mother more broadly as an entangled ethics of relationality, care, and kin-making beyond human reproduction. To promote a response-able approach to the issue of the desire to mother on the edge of the ecological disaster, we must address the unquestioned transgenerational and procreational models of motherhood and how these complicate the discussion on the reproductive rights of religious female subjects in the Western world. However, as the desire to mother extends toward shared response-ability and more inclusive futures, it requires questioning the human desire to reproduce.","[Rantala, Teija] Univ Turku, Fac Humanities, Turku 20500, Finland",teija.rantala@utu.fi,40,0,0,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,GENEALOGY-BASEL,Genealogy,2020,gold,

Understanding the composition and extent of marine habitats can inform marine protected area (MPA) planning and monitoring, help identify vulnerable or rare habitats and support fisheries management. To support conservation planning in Eastern Canada, we mapped the seafloor of Newman Sound, identifying the benthoscape classes (i.e. discrete biophysical seafloor classes) of this ecologically diverse and unique fjord in Newfoundland and Labrador (NL). Mapping was achieved using multibeam echosounder (MBES) data collected using multiple platforms, seafloor videos and an unsupervised pixel-based classification method. Seven benthoscape classes were identified within the extent of the MBES coverages. Multivariate statistical analyses indicate that two benthoscape classes - mixed boulder and mud - support distinct epifaunal communities, and also capture the changes in benthic community composition between hard/shallow substrates and soft/deep substrates. Our results illustrate how benthoscape maps can inform marine spatial planning and conservation in the Newman Sound region, support monitoring and also calls for adaptive management of the adjacent Eastport MPA.","[Proudfoot, Beatrice; Devillers, Rodolphe; Ediner, Evan; Copeland, Alison] Mem Univ Newfoundland, Dept Geog, St John, NF, Canada; [Devillers, Rodolphe] Inst Rech Dev IRD, Maison Teledetect Montpellier, Espace Dev, UMR 228, Montpellier, France; [Brown, Craig J.] Dalhousie Univ, Dept Oceanog, Halifax, NS, Canada; [Ediner, Evan] Mem Univ Newfoundland, Dept Biol, St John, NF, Canada; [Copeland, Alison] Govt Bermuda, Dept Environm & Nat Resources, Flatts, Bermuda",bproudfoot@mun.ca,66,6,6,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1400-0350,J COAST CONSERV,J.

Knowledge regarding how wildlife respond to anthropogenic change is vital for informing conservation efforts in such landscapes, including the design of nature reserves and wildlife corridors. To better understand how threatened species persist and behave within human-dominated landscapes, we examined the home range and space use of the nationally endangered southern brown bandicootIsoodon obesulus obesulusin peri-urban Melbourne, Australia's second-largest city. Specifically, we examined whether: (1) bandicoots were confined to linear strips of remnant vegetation or also made use of the broader highly modified landscape matrix; (2) the configuration of the linear vegetated strips affected home range shape; and (3) home range area differed between bandicoots living in linear strips and those in larger remnant habitat patches. We found that: (1) 71% of adult males and 33% of adult females used the matrix, but non-dispersing juveniles were entirely confined to the linear strips; males also travelled greater distances into the matrix (away from the vegetated strips) than females; (2) bandicoots had longer home ranges in narrower strips and males had longer home ranges than females; and (3) home range area for both sexes was smaller in linear strips than has been recorded in other studies in larger remnant habitats. Our study highlights the importance of retaining narrow, fragmented and modified vegetation to accommodate threatened biodiversity within human-dominated landscapes, but suggests the surrounding matrix may also offer important resources for adaptable species, such as bandicoots. Supporting off-reserve conservation of biodiversity in novel ecosystems is increasingly pertinent in our rapidly urbanizing world.","[Maclagan, S. J.; Ritchie, E.

Effective mitigation strategies are urgently required to resolve this issue. In the Garhwal Himalayas, local people's high dependency on forest resources is a major cause of habitat loss, which paves the way for human-primate interactions in this area. To investigate the socioeconomic factors that might explain langur crop-foraging, we conducted structured interviews among 215 households in the Garhwal Himalayas in India. We also examined langur resource use by monitoring their feeding and sleeping site activity. Less agricultural land, less agricultural production, and possession of large numbers of livestock significantly predicted villagers reporting crop-foraging events, although economic status of the correspondents did not have any effect. Perception of the villagers about reduction in forest resource was significantly affected by the amount of livestock possessed by the villagers. Our observations suggested that Banj oak Quercus leucotrichophora was the dominant species (59.2%, N = 306) in the pool of sleeping trees used by the langurs. Langurs also showed a preference in their use of sleeping sites and feeding sites, which were different from that expected by chance. Sleeping sites with high density of oak were re-used most frequently. Similarly, dense oak patches were also the preferred feeding patches. Thus, we suggest replanting of oak trees and conservation of intact oak patches, environmental education outreach, and empowerment of women in the community as potential mitigating factors to lessen the interaction between humans and langurs.

Coastal areas are home to increasing numbers of people and population growth is expected to continue, putting TCMEs under pressure from development as well as broader environmental changes associated with climate change, e.g. sea level rise and ocean acidification. Attention to TCMEs by conservation organizations has increased and although a variety of interventions to promote conservation and sustainable development of TCMEs have been implemented, evidence regarding the outcomes of these-for people or ecosystems-is scattered and unclear. This study takes a systematic mapping approach to identify articles that examine the ecological and social outcomes associated with conservation interventions in TCMEs; specifically in coral reef, mangrove, and seagrass habitats. Methods We developed a comprehensive framework of conservation interventions and outcomes, drawing on existing frameworks and related evidence synthesis projects, as well as interviews with marine conservation practitioners. We modified existing frameworks to: (i) include features of TCME that are not fully captured in existing frameworks; and (ii) further specify and/or regroup existing interventions or outcomes. We developed a search string informed by habitat, geography, interventions, and outcomes of interest, to search the peer-reviewed primary literature in four bibliographic databases and the grey literature on relevant institutional websites. All searches will be conducted in English. We will screen returned articles at the title and abstract level. Included articles will be screened at full text level and data coding will follow. Number of articles and reasons for excluding at full text level screening will be recorded. At each phase (title and abstract screening, full text screening, data coding), articles will be assessed independently by two members of the review team. Coded data will be reported in a narrative review and a database accessible through an open access, searchable data portal.

Here, we explore the ecological traits related to endemism and rarity, and identify the variables other than range size associated with the conservation status. As found in other studies, narrow endemics seem to be prevalently adapted to stressful habitats in which aboveground competition is relatively low. In ecological terms, the greatest richness is found in mid-altitude calcareous rocky habitats, and secondarily in open Mediterranean shrubby formations. Coastal, steppic and alpine habitats contribute to endemism in specific regions and the species that inhabit them tend to have small ranges. A large percentage of narrow endemics (19%) grow on special substrates, underlying the importance of edaphic islands as drivers of spatial isolation. More productive habitats such as grasslands, wetlands and forests are negatively associated with endemism, and endemics occurring therein tend to be widely distributed. A total of 454 endemic taxa (25% of total endemics) are regarded as threatened, most of which belong to species-rich lineages. Certain ecological settings appear to be more likely to contain threatened species than others, wet lowlands, coastal habitats and steppic scrub being the most significant in decreasing order. Paradoxically, the areas of occupancy of the species occurring therein are relatively less protected. On the contrary, a large proportion of montane and alpine habitats are protected and many endemics found there are regarded as non-threatened at present. Nevertheless, some centers of endemism located at high elevations are at risk due to global warming.","[Buira, Antoni; Aedo, Carlos] Real Jardin Bot CSIC, Plaza Murillo 2, Madrid 28014, Spain; [Cabezas, Francisco] Univ Complutense, Dept Biodiversidad Ecol & Evoluc, E-28040 Madrid, Spain",abuira@rjb.csic.es,85,7,7,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0960-3115,BIODIVERS CONSERV,Biodivers.

Many lineages tend to maintain their niche characteristics over evolutionary time, a phenomenon known as phylogenetic niche conservatism (NC), which can slow the processes of ecological speciation by diversification selection. NC can, however, promote speciation through neutral evolution, favoring the geographic isolation of populations. Among the mega-diverse Rodentia group, the low species richness of the family Caviidae stands out. Here, we analyzed if the processes of climatic NC are related to the slow diversification observed in the Caviidae family. Locality data for 13 species and nine climatic variables were used to generate ecological niche models. Niche similarity was quantified using the Schoener D index and used to examine correlations between the times of species divergence and niche similarities, thus characterizing their niche occupation profiles (NOP). The NOP were subsequently used to perform phylogenetic niche reconstructions for these species. Niche models accurately described known distributions of species. The greatest niche overlap documented was between Kerodon rupestris and Galea spixii (0.86). The niche and species divergence times showed a negative correlation (beta = -0.013; p = 0.01). These results support the existence of NC, with phylogenetically closer species occupying similar niches, and emphasize the importance of NC in diversification processes at continental scales in a slowly diversifying group.","[da Silva, Darlan; Aires, Anderson Eduardo; Martinez, Pablo Ariel] Univ Fed Sergipe, Dept Biol, Lab Pesquisas Integrat Biodiversidade, PIBi Lab, Sao Cristovao, Brazil; [Zurano, Juan Pablo] Univ Fed Paraiba, Ctr Ciencias Exatas & Nat, Programa Posgrad Ciencias Biol, Joao Pessoa, Paraiba, Brazil; [Angel Olalla-Tarraga, Miguel] Univ Rey Juan Carlos, Dept Biol & Geol Phys & Inorgan Chem, BioMa Biodivers & Macroecol Lab, Madrid, Spain",ds.darlandasilva@gmail.com,78,1,1,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1064-7554,J MAMM EVOL,J.

This study focuses on two comparative villages (negeri): Haruku and South Buano. The study adopts a historically situated new institutionalism approach to analyzing the dynamic developments of kewang and how it affects community members in the context of conservation and natural resource management of the petuanan customary areas of the two negeri. By examining institutional change including history, ideology, organization and authority of kewang with other institutional forms such as soa, government, church, and NGOs the study shows the path-dependence of the two respective kewangs. In Haruku, the kewang has long stayed intact because the institution is still practiced as a cultural principle, maintaining itself through the tradition-based leadership succession mechanisms and by continuing to carry out its functions, as well as pursuing innovations within kewang education for future generations. In South Buano however, due to the long absence of a kewang, efforts at revival show the strong influence of rational choice thinking principles, dependent on the formal authority of the negeri government. The study concludes that historical junctures shape the role and authority of kewangs in performing natural resource functions, and which can have longnstanding generational impacts on conservation possibilities. Meanwhile, kewang also rely on both its continued endogenous acceptance among local community members, and depend on its relations with other key institutions in society.","[Batiran, Karno B.; Salim, Ishak] PAYO PAYO Maros, Peasant Sch Network, South Sulawesi, Indonesia; [Salim, Ishak] Univ Teknol Sulawesi, Polit Sci Dept, Makassar, Indonesia; [Salim, Ishak] Open Univ, Heerlen, Netherlands",karnobatiran@payopayo.or.id; asriyanihalia@gmail.com,17,1,2,"MAKASSAR, FAK KEHUTANAN UNIV HASANUDDIN",MAKASSAR,"JALAN PERINTIS KEMERDEKAAN KM 10, MAKASSAR, 90245, INDONESIA",2549-4724,FOR SOC,For.

Agro-pastoral ecologically-vulnerable areas face challenges such as insufficient ecosystem conservation, low agricultural production, and weak economies. In this study, 215 farm households from Zhengxiangbai Banner, Taibus Banner, and Duolun County of Inner Mongolia were surveyed. The sustainable livelihoods framework of the United Kingdom (UK) Department for International Development (DFID) was used to measure the livelihood capital of these farm households. A one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was applied to examine the differences in the livelihood capital of different types households, and a correlation analysis was applied to analyze its impact on cultivated land utilization. Results showed that households with non-farming activities accounted for 64.7% of the total surveyed households, and non-farming employment was becoming more prevalent. Physical and financial capital was the driving factors for livelihood diversity. Each livelihood capital had key factors that affected household farmland use behaviors, such as the age of householder, the labor ratio, proportion of income, farmland scale, number of machines, and these had a significantly positive or negative influence on farmland use. Full-time farming households were more likely to transfer the land into cultivation and invest more labor, while non-farming households with high income were likely to transfer farmland out and invest more money to develop efficient farming or improve the employment skills. The results of this study suggest that policymakers need to fully consider livelihood changes of local households. It is effective to strengthen labor training, create farmland market and improve the efficiency of farmland utilization. We hope to achieve a win-win scenario to improve local economies and ecosystem conservation.","[Liu, Haiyan; Hao, Haiguang; Hu, Xujun; Du, Leshan; Zhang, Zhe; Li, Yuanyuan] Chinese Res Inst Environm Sci, State Key Lab Environm Criteria & Risk Assessment, Beijing 100012, Peoples R China",haohg@craes.org.cn,64,5,5,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1002-0063,CHINESE GEOGR SCI,Chin.

One of the eminent pioneers of urban ecology is the German ecologist Herbert Sukopp, who works in Berlin since the late 1950s and is often referred to as the founder of the Berlin School of Urban Ecology. On the occasion of his 90th anniversary in 2020, this paper aims to recognize and commemorate the major contributions of Sukopp to the field of urban ecology, based on his scientific work and on results of an online survey on his perception in the international scientific community. Sukopp's contributions were groundbreaking for the establishment of urban ecology. Specifically, his work furthered: (1) the performance of comprehensive biodiversity studies across all land-use types within the city, in relation to the specifics of urban environments; (2) the establishment of modern approaches of nature conservation in cities and their integration into all land-use types, and the city as a whole; (3) the formation of a multidisciplinary conceptual basis of urban ecology as a modern science, with combined scientific and applied perspectives, ultimately aiming at the preservation and further development of nature within cities for the benefit of urban residents.

Evaluating the potential of different strategies for delivering co-benefits for nature and people will require the use and testing of clear causal models that explicitly define the logic and assumptions behind cause and effect relationships. Objectives and methods In this study, we outline criteria for credible causal models and systematically evaluated their use in a broad base of literature (similar to 1,000 peer-reviewed and grey literature articles from a published systematic evidence map) on links between nature-based conservation actions and human well-being impacts.

With this aim, it will be evaluated whether natural environment in the most harmonious and most productive way for the users of the campus. Methodology: In the research, Selcuk University Alaaddin Keykubat Campus was examined in terms of ecological landscape design. In this context, water-efficient landscaping, design with topography, energy efficient landscape design (energy-efficient landscaping, transportation system etc.), sustainable farming practices, permaculture, the existence of green roof and green wall applications, supporting biodiversity, selection of hard landscaping materials, presence of alternative green areas (green roof, green walls, etc.), and presence of recycling applications were questioned. Results: Although an ecological appropriate designs were made on Selcuk University Campus. There was not a design approach related to holistic plan. In campus, there were some issues that must be developed in terms of ecological landscape design and planning on some topics such as; energy conservation, waste management, sustainable landscape materials, water management, wildlife/habitat conservation, pest management, landscape maintenace and trasportation and parking. Increase in compost use and diversifying compost materials, creating permeable surfaces rather than materials such as asphalt, concrete etc., that doest not allow rain water to get through, by this way canalizing rain water directly into the soil and reducing surface runoff are few solutions for ecological landscape design and planning. Interpretation: Achieving campus sustainability and sustainable landscape design more effectively is not possible without the cooperation and involvement of all stakeholders such as students, faculty and staff, university management, funding agencies, and community.","[Kurtaslan, B.

The consideration of coastal marine areas as social-ecological systems (CMSESs) can be useful for marine biodiversity conservation. This integrative approach incorporates social information that can link anthropogenic activities to marine biodiversity, providing opportunities for improving conservation policies tailored to the specific reality of the CMSESs. Here, we assessed the beta and alpha diversity of the shallow littoral fish communities present in the Andalusian CMSESs and explored how they relate to socioeconomic and marine environmental variables. We used underwater visual surveys to estimate the fish abundance data needed to calculate the alpha and beta diversity of the fish species. We quantified the species and functional beta diversity using abundance-based data. We also quantified species richness index as indicators of species alpha diversity, and functional evenness as indicators of functional alpha diversity. We found that the association of marine environmental and socioeconomic variables with biodiversity varied with CMSES. Empirical inclusion of biodiversity in social-ecological systems research of marine and coastal areas can provide insights on human-nature dynamics. This can contribute to design more effective marine biodiversity conservation programs that consider both the socioeconomic and marine environmental characteristics of each CMSES.","[Lazzari, Natali; Sanabria-Fernandez, Jose A.; Becerro, Mikel A.] Ctr Adv Studies Blanes CEAB CSIC, BITES Lab, Acc Cala S Francesc 14, Blanes 17300, Gerona, Spain; [Martin-Lopez, Berta] Leuphana Univ Luneburg, Fac Sustainabil, Inst Eth & Transdisciplinary Sustainabil Res, Univ Allee 1, D-21355 Luneburg, Germany; [Sanabria-Fernandez, Jose A.] INMAR, Dept Phys Chem, Fac Marine & Environm Sci, Avd Republ Arabe Saharaui S-N, Puerto Real 11510, Spain",lazzari.natali@gmail.com; martinlo@leuphana.de; jsanabriafernandez@gmail.com; mikel.becerro@csic.es,52,6,6,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1470-160X,ECOL INDIC,Ecol.

Using these time-series data (sparse and noisy datasets drawn from deterministic Lotka-Volterra systems with two to nine species, of known network structure), dynamic model forecasts of whether a species' future population will be positively or negatively affected by rapid eradication of another species were correct > 70% of the time.

The Irish Sea is a busy waterway under the jurisdiction of six entities (Northern Ireland, the Republic of Ireland, the Isle of Man, Scotland, England, and Wales). Within this body of water there are almost 200 conservation designations across 111 MPA sites, with many sites having multiple designations (national, EU, and international). Data is lacking on the effectiveness of these protected areas in reaching their conservation objectives due to sites being inadequately monitored. The race to meet the 10% marine protected area target set by the Conservation on Biological Diversity, however, may be compromising effective planning. Do multiple designations ensure better protection of the marine environment, or is the Irish Sea home to paper parks, offering little protection? Metadata compiled from the World Database on Protected Areas and conservation reports from MPA managers were used to investigate this question. The results show a positive correlation between the number of designations of a site and the existence of a publicly available management plan. The presence of a management plan was also linked to whether or not site assessments were conducted by the relevant authorities, and sites having multiple designations was weakly correlated with favourable assessment outcomes. The results of this study highlight the need to better understand the requirements of national, regional and international-level conservation designations and how they interact with each other.","[Schere, C.

Three patterns have been widely reported in the research literature regarding the relationship between realised niches and macronutrient concentration gradients: (1) species' optima are unevenly distributed, with a higher frequency in mesic conditions; (2) species' response curves are narrower when optima density is higher; and (3) species with optima at the extremes of the gradients have skewed response curves with a longer tail toward mesic conditions. This study aims to test the existence of these patterns on a vegetation model occurring in metalliferous soils comprising copper and cobalt along a toxicity gradient in south-eastern D.R. Congo. Realised niches of 80 taxa were modelled using generalised additive models. The niche optima and the niche widths were determined for each taxon. Results highlighted three groups which differ according to the niche optima location along the soil metal concentration gradients.

Although IUCN considers it to be 'Least Concern,' the Common Monitor Lizard faces several threats throughout its global distribution range, and the status of the species is decreasing rapidly. The Dhaleswari River of Assam (India) is one of the most important abodes of this species, where it is locally known by the names 'Irong' and 'Shanda.' Geographically, the Dhaleswari River is located in southern Assam (India), which falls within the Indo-Burma Biodiversity hotspot area. Unfortunately, most of the wildlife of southern Assam (India) are poorly studied, and this varanid is one of the most ignored species of the region. The present study was conducted along the Dhaleswari River, Assam, India, to elucidate the distribution, status, ecology, threats, and conservation of the Common Water Monitor, and is the first report on this species from this river. The results show that the Dhaleswari River still serves as a habitat of the species, with a viable population. Further, the species was found to prefer smaller rivers with clayed soil and bushes, and it faces major threats from habitat destruction, hunting for flesh and oil, and conflicts with humans.

Currently, the research on water conservation has mainly focused on a single biome type, in particular, forests. Few studies explore the differences in water conservation functions of different biome types. Research on this topic mostly utilizes field investigations and sample plot settings to explore the differences in water conservation capacity of a small number of tree species, but these methods are limited in time and space. Therefore, this study uses MODIS products to evaluate the water conservation function of different biome types in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. Dynamic monitoring of the vegetation and water conservation capacity in the study area and research on the responses of the water conservation functions of different biome types were conducted. The results indicate that the vegetation of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau increased slightly from 2000 to 2015; however, due to the dual influence of climate and topographic factors, the water conservation capacity showed a slight decline. The water conservation service function mainly comes from grassland ecosystems, which are closely related to vegetation density and biome types. Therefore, to greatly improve the water conservation service function of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, the management and planting of vegetation should be conducted according to the optimal vegetation coverage area, vegetation quantities and biome types.","[Wu, Shuying; Zhou, Wei; Yan, Kai] China Univ Geosci, Sch Land Sci & Technol, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Wei] Minist Nat Resources, Key Lab Land Remediat, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Wei] Min Area Ecol Restorat Engn Technol Innovat Ctr, Nat Resources Dept, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Xunxun] China Geol Survey Bur, Geol Survey Ctr Civil Mil Integrat, Chengdu 610036, Peoples R China",wusy@cugb.edu.cn; zhouw@cugb.edu.cn; kaiyan@cugb.edu.cn; zhangxunxun9511@163.com,71,3,3,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",1939-1404,IEEE J-STARS,IEEE J.

However, in the high-groundwater coal basins where coal seams and agricultural production overlap, mining subsidence destroys much arable land, causing a series of environmental and social issues. This study investigated plants, beetles, spiders and birds in typical intensive farmlands and farmlands containing mining subsidence mosaics (i.e., mosaic farmlands) in North China. The species composition of these four taxonomic groups differed significantly between the intensive farmlands and mosaic farmlands, with 271 plant, 17 spider, 49 beetle and 138 bird species in the mosaic farmlands and 76, 12, 35 and 30 such species in the intensive farmlands, respectively. The mosaic farmlands hosted more and different species than the intensive farmlands. Additionally, these four taxonomic groups, especially plants and birds, showed a higher abundance and diversity in mosaic farmlands than in intensive ones. These mosaics thus have increased biodiversity conservation value. We emphasize that attention should be paid not only to the environmental damage and human property loss caused by coal mining subsidence but also to the ecological opportunities from the formation of such new habitats. These post-mining habitats represent a new ecological landscape that should be a part of natural conservation.","[Zhang, G. X.; Yuan, X. Z.; Wang, K. H.; Zhang, M. J.; Zhou, L. L.; Zhang, Q.

In which, several perspectives such as economic, water conservation, soil conservation and carbon sink were considered comprehensively. The two major indicators of water regulation and water treatment were used to measure the benefits of water conservation, and the benefits were calculated according to the perspective of soil conservation. In addition, the investment benefits of the project was evaluated to determine the complex income and value of the project. The results revealed that the initial input-output ratio of the three interest rates is very low, the conservation soil value of camphor and Taxus is not obvious in the early stage, the I/O ratio increases rapidly with the increase of years, and the input-output ratio is low in the initial stage.

However, it is unclear whether ENMs are always beneficial for such purposes. We quantified the benefit of using ENMs in conservation prioritization, comparing the numbers of species covered by conservation areas selected on the basis of probabilities estimated by ENMs (ENM approach) and those selected on the basis of raw observation data (raw-data approach), while controlling survey range, survey bias, and target size of conservation area. We evaluated three ENM algorithms (GLM, GAM, and random forests). We used virtual community data generated by simulation for the evaluation. ENM approach was effective when survey bias is strong, survey range is narrow, and target size of conservation area is moderate. The percentage of cases in which the ENM approach outperformed the raw-data approach ranged from 0.0 to 33% (GLM), 31% (GAM), and 75% (random forests) depending on conditions. The number of rare species (< 20 presence records) included in the conservation area based on the ENM approach was less than, or the same as, that of the raw-data approach. The unexpectedly limited cases in which the ENM approach was effective in the present research may depend on the conservation target we used (to cover as many species as possible in conservation area). Our results highlight urgent need for evaluating ENM's effectiveness under other conservation targets for wise use of ENM in conservation prioritization.","[Ishihama, Fumiko; Takenaka, Akio; Yokomizo, Hiroyuki; Kadoya, Taku] Natl Inst Environm Studies, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan",ishihama@nies.go.jp,36,2,3,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",1932-6203,PLOS ONE,PLoS One,2019,"Green Submitted, Green Published, gold",

Therefore, we applied the system conservation planning method, including stakeholder's participation, to the planning process of the Park. Then, according to the value of diversity of each site, we set the purpose and objectives of protection. The system conservation planning method aims to achieve the largest ecological conservation purposes with the minimum socio-economic cost, and to promote the development of the South Penghu Marine National Park marine protected area. Therefore, we used coral coverage rate and fish richness data, as well as socio-economic data on the harvest of the most used fishing techniques, i.e., fishing line, long line, trolling line, and gill net. The results of the Marxan analysis show that the coral coverage rate is notably high along the coast of the islands of Dongyu Pingyu, Xiyu Pingyu, and Dongjiyu, where the fishing industry is not fully developed because of the existing seabed type.

Although existing literature has established that these two sectors often share the same space and rely on similar logics, it is increasingly common to find biodiversity conservation being carried out through partnerships between extractive and conservation actors. In this article, we explore what this cooperation achieves for both sectors. Using illustrative examples of extractive-conservation collaboration across sub-Saharan Africa, we argue that new entanglements between extractive and conservation actors are motivated by multiple purposes. First, partnering with conservation actors serves as a spatial and socio-ecological fix for extractive companies in response to multiple crises that threaten the sector's productivity. Second, new forms of collaboration between extractive and conservation actors create pathways for both sectors to produce new value from nature. For the extractive sector, creating new value from nature works as a further fix to capitalist crises whereas, for the conservation sector, producing value through nature amounts to new opportunities for capital accumulation. Importantly, working together to produce shared value from nature within and beyond extractive concessions secures both sectors' control over the means of production. Theoretically, our analysis links literature on value in capitalist nature with that on spatial and socio-ecological fixes.","[Enns, Charis; Bersaglio, Brock] Univ Sheffield, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England; [Enns, Charis; Bersaglio, Brock] Aga Khan Univ, Nairobi, Kenya; [Sneyd, Adam] Univ Guelph, Guelph, ON, Canada",c.enns@sheffield.ac.uk,80,6,6,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",2514-8486,ENVIRON PLAN E-NAT,Environ.

However, the potential benefits of ecological restoration on beta diversity have never been explored. Here we use field data to investigate, for the first time, if restoration plantings enhance the taxonomic and functional plant beta diversity in a fragmented landscape of the threatened Atlantic forest. Woody species were evaluated for 320 plots established in 18 forest fragments and 14 restoration plantings within a sugarcane production landscape with low forest cover, in southeastern Brazil. Diversity metrics were assessed using the multiple incidence-data version of Hill numbers and were compared among three sets of study sites: fragments, restoration plantings and the two combined. Fragments showed higher levels of alpha diversity and proportional abundance of non-pioneer and animal-dispersed species than restoration plantings. Exotic, pioneer and non-zoochoric species were more abundant in restoration plantings, an expected result considering sites still be in the early or mid-successional stages of development. Taxonomic and functional beta diversity of trees was greatest when both areas were combined. For regenerating plants, however, beta diversity results varied according to species incidence-based frequencies. Although restoration plantings do not result in full recovery of alpha diversity, they can all together complement diversity of forest fragments at the landscape level. The findings indicate two key ecological implications for biodiversity conservation: the critical importance of forest fragments as biodiversity repositories and the positive effect of restoration efforts on landscape-scale diversity in degraded regions. These novel results highlight the importance of species selection for restoration initiatives toward species and functional attributes recognized as significantly reduced or locally rare. Overall, forest fragments and restoration plantings can act synergistically to promote recovery of plant diversity in heavily deforested agricultural landscapes.","[Rother, Debora Cristina; Liboni, Ana Paula] Univ Estadual Campinas, Inst Biol, Dept Biol Vegetal, Campinas, SP, Brazil; [Rother, Debora Cristina; Liboni, Ana Paula; Rodrigues, Ricardo Ribeiro] Univ Sao Paulo, Escola Super Agr Luiz de Queiroz, Lab Ecol & Restauracao Florestal, Piracicaba, SP, Brazil; [Silva Magnago, Luiz Fernando] Univ Fed Sul Bahia, Itabuna, BA, Brazil; [Chao, Anne] Natl Tsing Hua Univ, Inst Stat, Hsinchu 30043, Taiwan; [Chazdon, Robin L.] Univ Connecticut, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Storrs, CT USA",deborarother@gmail.com,68,3,3,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0378-1127,FOREST ECOL MANAG,For.

These pressures have caused the decline of A. pallipes populations in Europe, demonstrating the importance of predicting the species' potential distribution under current and future conditions. Focusing on the watercourses of mainland France, we aimed to identify suitable areas for A. pallipes to guide the conservation of current populations and future introduction actions or protection measures. We applied ecological niche modelling to model the potential distribution of both A. pallipes and P. leniusculus and identified locations suitable for A. pallipes only. We also assessed the potential distribution of the species under two representative concentration pathway (RCP) scenarios: RCP 2.6 and RCP 8.5, respectively describing low-warming and high-warming conditions. We found that A. pallipes and P. leniusculus exploit equivalent niches in France. Despite this, under current conditions, about 5% of the study area simultaneously records a high suitability for A. pallipes and a low suitability for P. leniusculus and is therefore of significant conservation interest. This percentage remains relatively stable under RCP 2.6 for 2050 and 2100, but decreases to 2% under RCP 8.5 for 2100.

Such risk of becoming invalid nature reserves is particularly high in China's Bohai Sea coastal zone, a region with rapid urbanization and industrialization. In this study, the ecological quality (EQ) status around Laizhou Bay Ostrea rivularis germplasm reserve (R1), Yellow River Estuary Meretrix meretrix germplasm reserve (R2), and Taoer Estuary Sinonovacula constricta germplasm reserve (R3) was dynamically diagnosed using seven indicators characterizing ecological support and threat from peripheral environments. A series of thresholds indicating EQ and corresponding landscape artificialization intensity (LAI) were determined based on multi-factor clustering analysis and relational regression simulation. The results show that the surroundings of these three reserves were favorable in 1984, insufficient in 2000, and unfavorable in 2015. With an average 7.5 times increase in LAI over the past three decades, the EQ levels around R1-R3 declined significantly and have deviated greatly from their optimal reference status by 2015, which stemmed mainly from intertidal landscape artificialization, such as establishing salt pans, industrial areas and ports after reclaiming wetlands. It was found that R3 > R1 > R2 in terms of overall peripheral ecological degradation, implying that the closer the marine reserve is to the land, the more likely it is to lose its effectiveness. The changes in EQ status and LAI were well indicated by the proportion of natural ecosystems, the distance between seawalls and protected boundaries, and the reserves' enclosed degree by artificial systems, which, as a quick and simple diagnostic approach, can facilitate spatial planning and management practices around marine reserves in the Bohai Sea coastal zone and elsewhere.

Through reviewing the existing studies in relation to agroforestry and soil and water conservation, this paper systematically investigates into the ecological benefits from agroforestry, including the increase of carbon sequestration and soil fertility as well as soil microfauna, the conservation of soil and water, the mitigation of soil pollution and the reduction of greenhouse gas emission. It founds, across KRD areas, that there exists coupling ecological benefits when practicing agroforestry and conserving soil and water. Based on this finding, this paper further suggests the corresponding key technologies that welcome more studies: preventing soil leakage from underground; effectively utilizing water from above-and-below ground; developing highly-efficient and value-added water-saving industries; forming forest-grain-grass stereo optimal configuration. The aim is to ensure a favorable Eco-environment while at the same time to develop beneficial ecological industries across KRD areas.","[Wu, Qinglin; Liang, Hong; Xiong, Kangning; Li, Rui] Guizhou Normal Univ, Sch Karst, State Key Engn Technol Res Ctr KRD Rehabil, Guiyang 550001, Guizhou, Peoples R China",492172078@qq.com,84,2,3,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0167-4366,AGROFOREST SYST,Agrofor.

We review and contrast different evaluation approaches and highlight the advantages of counterfactual approaches over alternative methods. We also illustrate how even robust estimates of ecological impact can fail to estimate the impact of specific policy interventions. The latter depend importantly on human preferences and responses to regulations and incentives that cannot be captured by studies of ecological impact.

Delivery of information, particularly about future conditions and the uncertainties associated with it, involves a range of judgements, or ethical considerations, including treatment of forecast failure, inequity in stakeholder response options, and winners and losers in commercial markets. Here, we explore these often unanticipated considerations via a set of case studies spanning commercial fishing, recreational fishing, aquaculture, and conservation applications. We suggest that consideration of ethical issues by scientists and their research partners is needed to maintain scientific integrity and fairness to end users.

In boreal forests, emulating natural disturbances is commonly used as a restoration tool for improving habitat quality for a range of sensitive species. We assessed the consequences of prescribed burning and artificial gap creation on the demographic parameters of an insectivorous bird, the pied flycatcher (Ficedula hypoleuca). This to improve our ability to develop strategies for successful ecological restoration aiming at improving the conservation status of boreal forest birds. Pied flycatchers reproduced equally well in nature reserves, forests subjected to ecological restoration and untreated control stands. Nestling body weight was found to be higher in stands restored through prescribed burning. Considering that nestling condition at the time of fledging is known to be positively related to survival rates after fledging, our results suggest a positive effect of prescribed burning on population dynamics and on local habitat quality. Our findings should encourage forest managers to actively use prescribed burning as a management tool in boreal forests to complement other conservation measures. However, one should be careful with generalizing these results to other bird species as they only are directly applicable to pied flycatchers. Still, they may potentially apply also to other insectivorous bird species with similar habitat requirements. In addition, it should be stressed that to maintain diverse boreal forest bird assemblages, heterogeneous landscapes are needed including both burned and unburned forest of different successional stages.","[Versluijs, Martijn; Roberge, Jean-Michel; Boer, Jorina; Hjalten, Joakim] Swedish Univ Agr Sci SLU, Dept Wildlife Fish & Environm Studies, SE-90183 Umea, Sweden; [Eggers, Sonke] Swedish Univ Agr Sci SLU, Dept Ecol, Box 7044, SE-75007 Uppsala, Sweden; [Roberge, Jean-Michel] Swedish Forest Agcy, Box 284, SE-90106 Umea, Sweden",martlin.versluijs@slu.se,84,4,4,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0006-3207,BIOL CONSERV,Biol.

Insular ecosystems often provide unusually stressful microhabitats for plant growth (due, for example, to their characteristically thin soils, high temperatures, extreme pH, or limited nutrients) to which rare species are specially adapted. Climate-driven changes to these stressors may undermine the competitive advantage of stress-adapted species, allowing them to be displaced by competitors, or may overwhelm their coping strategies altogether. Special features of insular ecosystems - such as extreme habitat fragmentation and association with unusual landscape features - could also affect their climate sensitivity and adaptive capacity. To help predict and manage climate-change impacts, I present a simple conceptual framework based on a synthesis of over 300 site-level studies. Using this framework, conservation efforts can leverage existing ecological knowledge to anticipate habitat changes and design targeted strategies for conserving rare species.","[Cartwright, Jennifer] US Geol Survey, Lower Mississippi Gulf Water Sci Ctr, Nashville, TN 37211 USA",jmcart@usgs.gov,67,19,20,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1540-9295,FRONT ECOL ENVIRON,Front.

We radio-tracked 28 A. mutica from 2013 to 2014 and used an information theoretic approach to select the best models describing movement and home range estimates. Mean movement rate was 142.3 m/day and was highly variable with some movements >2 km/day. Movement peaked at moderate water temperatures early in the active season, increased at higher water levels for females, and was greater in the higher stream order. The sexes responded differently to environmental variation, with female movement higher in most but not all conditions. The most informative home range estimate was a 95% kernel density estimate using likelihood cross-validation (CVh) smoothing clipped to the river channel. The mean home range size was 18.1 hectares and increased with movement rate, number of radio-locations, and stream order.

Yet, there is no global framework to prioritize research and conservation actions on them. We identify for the first time the factors driving extinction risk and scientific attention on raptors and develop a novel research and conservation priority index (RCPI) to identify global research and conservation priorities. Location Global. Methods We use random forest models based on ecological traits and extrinsic data to identify the drivers of risk and scientific attention in all raptors. We then map global research and conservation priorities. Lastly, we model where priorities fall relative to country-level human social indicators. Results Raptors with small geographic ranges, scavengers, forest-dependent species and those with slow life histories are particularly extinction-prone. Research is extremely biased towards a small fraction of raptor species: 10 species (1.8% of all raptors) account for one-third of all research, while one-fifth of species have no publications. Species with small geographic ranges and those inhabiting less developed countries are greatly understudied. Regions of Latin America, Africa and Southeast Asia are identified as particularly high priority for raptor research and conservation. These priorities are highly concentrated in developing countries, indicating a global mismatch between priorities and capacity for research and conservation. Main conclusions A redistribution of scientific attention and conservation efforts towards developing tropical countries and the least-studied, extinction-prone species is critical to conserve raptors and their ecological functions worldwide. We identify clear taxonomic and geographic research and conservation priorities for all raptors, and our methodology can be applied across other taxa to prioritize scientific investment.","[Buechley, Evan R.; Oleyar, Dave] HawkWatch Int, Salt Lake City, UT 84106 USA; [Buechley, Evan R.; Neate-Clegg, Montague H.

Artificial manipulation of these dynamics for biased reasons (e.g., controlling floods, improving fisheries) aggravates conflicts between stakeholders and introduces potential threats to their conservation. This is the case at Laguna de Rocha, Uruguay, a protected area with international recognition, where the sand barrier opening has been the focus of a long-term conflict. A cooperative effort of scientists, authorities, and local stakeholders produced a breaching protocol, aimed to reduce conflicts while preserving the natural hydrodynamics of the system and its associated ecological processes. Historical information and present perceptions about the sand barrier breach were collected, and geomorphological and hydrological studies were carried out. Reconstruction of the historical management of the breaching practice showed that the artificial opening started in the 1950s and that the original procedure, performed by fishermen and cattle ranchers, was gradually left under to managers to, and it is presently performed with heavy machinery. Since the 1980s, inappropriate opening practices may have produced negative effects on the physical and biological structure of the lagoon. Geomorphological studies revealed the sand barrier as a highly vulnerable component of the lagoon and suggested that new opening sites could eventually develop over the long term, given the predictions of climate change and sea level rise. The hydrological approach provided an understanding of the processes driving the opening mechanism and the extent of the flooding of private and public lands. These results outlined the basis for the protocol, to support managers in deciding when to perform the opening, based on a reduced set of indicators (water depth, sand barrier berm elevation, and rainfall forecasts). Reaching a consensus was mainly based upon the existence, for more than 15 years, of a participatory advisory group discussing local environmental problems.

While a focus on impacts from mean, long-term changes in climate is warranted, the vast majority of conservation plans largely ignore another key factor of climate change-changes in the frequency and intensity of extreme weather and climate events. A typology of the full range and severity of ecological responses to extreme events would help underpin tracking of their impacts. Location Global. Methods Here, we review 519 observational studies of ecological responses to extreme events between 1941 and 2015. We include responses from amphibians, birds, fish, invertebrates, mammals, plants and reptiles to cyclones, drought, flood, cold waves and heat waves. Results Negative ecological responses were the most commonly reported, accounting for 57% of all documented responses. There were over 100 cases of a >25% population decline and 31 cases of local extirpation. Sixty per cent of the studies in our review observed ecological responses for more than 1 year, and of the studies that monitored species or ecosystem recovery following exposure to an extreme event, 38% showed species or ecosystems did not recover to pre-disturbance levels. Main conclusions Extreme weather and climate events have profound implications for species and ecosystem management. We discuss current conceptual challenges associated with incorporating extreme events into conservation planning efforts, which include how to quantify species sensitivity and adaptive capacity to extreme events, how to account for interactions between extreme events and other stressors, and how to maximize adaptive capacity to more frequent and intense extreme events.","[Maxwell, Sean L.; Maron, Martine; McAlpine, Clive A.; Chapman, Sarah; Watson, James E.

In North America, priority areas of old-growth forest are often identified based primarily on the age of trees within the stand. However, delineating forests with high conservation value based solely on tree age is an oversimplification. Therefore, we propose a different view -that of forest continuity, a view that is more prevalent in Europe. We contend that forests that have been continuously wooded over time, whether old-growth trees are present or not, have higher conservation value than areas that have old trees but that may not always have been forested. Identifying forests with high continuity requires a different index than tree age. We argue that the relative richness and abundance of lichens can be effective indicators of forest continuity, discuss how forest managers might operationalize this system, and explain why it might be a more ecologically relevant indicator of priority forest areas.","[McMullin, R.

This aggravated an already tense situation of water shortage. Considering the low irrigation water utilization effectives of the urban green space system, the typical urban greening shrub (Ligustrum vicaryi) was selected as the research object of this study. In a pot experiment, three mulch materials were selected: gravel (CH1), pine needles + gravel (CH2), and bark + gravel (CH3). These materials were set to a uniform thickness of 3 cm, and soil water was maintained between 75% and 85% of the field capacity. Using the analytic hierarchy process and fuzzy mathematics model, the physiological and ecological response characteristics of Ligustrum vicaryi were investigated under different combinations of mulch material. The results for various processing, regarding plant growth, showed CH3 > CH2 > CH1 > CK (Control Check). The leaf area, total leaf area, and leaf area index of CH3 were, respectively, 21.4%, 21.9%, and 62.5% larger than those of the control check (CK). Regarding physiological characteristics, photosynthetic rate, evaporation rate, stomatal conductance, and water use efficiency of CH3 were better than for the other treatments. Regarding ecological services, carbon fixation, oxygen release, cooling, and quantity of humidification of CH3 were optimal. Considered comprehensively for the landscape function, physical characteristics, and ecological services of Ligustrum vicaryi, the preliminary thought is that bark and gravel dual-element mulch, with a layer thickness of 3 cm, was the optimal soil cover treatment for the typical city greening shrub Ligustrum vicaryi. Using the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and the fuzzy mathematical model for the evaluation of the effects of different soil cover treatments on the landscape function, ecological service function, and physiological characteristics of Ligustrum vicaryi was reliable and feasible. The model evaluation results match the actual ones.","[Wang, Caiyuan; Yang, Peiling; Li, Yunkai; Ren, Shumei] China Agr Univ, Coll Water Resources & Civil Engn, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China; [Wang, Caiyuan; Yang, Zhongshan; Zang, Min; Wang, Yajuan; Zhang, Xin] Beijing Hydrol Ctr, Beijing 100089, Peoples R China",wangcaiyuan555@163.com; yangpeiling@126.com; liyunkai@1126.com; gsh5566449868@163.com; renshumei@126.com; whzm79@163.com; 17640133045@163.com; zhouzh@mwr.gov.cn,23,1,1,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",2073-4441,WATER-SUI,Water,2019,"gold, Green Submitted",

We aimed to develop a repeatable approach to defining a community, both intact and degraded, based on its fauna. We demonstrate how the approach can be used to guide conservation-for example, determining whether a multispecies community of animals is threatened. Location Temperate and subtropical woodlands of Australia. Methods We used expert opinion to develop a definition of the Australian Temperate and Subtropical Woodland Bird Community and metrics of its condition. Using continental-scale vegetation change mapping, and national bird atlas data, we assessed this community against criteria for listing as a threatened ecological community under national biodiversity conservation law. Results We defined and described a recognizable and consistent Australian Temperate and Subtropical Woodland Bird Community. Although taxonomically and functionally very similar, we identified six community variants that show species- or genus-level substitutions. The community was evaluated to be Endangered or Critically Endangered across its extent based on criteria from Australia's Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999. We used a novel metric of condition using historical changes in woodland extent and bird species, to demonstrate the community has declined substantially in geographical extent and integrity and is subject to severe and ongoing threats. Conclusions The consequences of global change affect entire communities, not just single species; however, defining ecological communities based predominantly on plant species composition can fail to illuminate the complex associations of animals that are both sustained by, and sustain, the vegetation. In this study, we present a process for defining and evaluating the status of a fauna community against threat criteria.

Recent findings suggest that they could be applied at the landscape scale as vegetation conservation tools, but that some environmental dimensions (e.g., climate) need to be considered at larger scales. What is the importance of applying hierarchical SDMs combining information from different scales to ensure consistent local vegetation management decisions? Study Site Mainland Spain and Biosphere Reserve of Sierra del Rincon (central Spain). Methods We generated SDMs for five tree species at the regional scale (mainland Spain) using climatic variables plus presence/absence data from the Spanish National Forest Inventory; and at the landscape scale (Sierra del Rincon Biosphere Reserve) using local environmental variables plus locally gathered vegetation presence/absence data. Predictions of both regional and landscape models were combined at the landscape scale following two different hierarchical approaches. The four resulting predictions were compared with correlation coefficients and independently evaluated with the AUC statistic and data collected in the study area. Results The regional SDMs depict suitable climatic conditions for the tree species, while the landscape SDMs capture important local ecological drivers that influence habitat suitability at finer scales. Expectedly, the regional SDMs predict larger suitable areas than the landscape SDMs. The predictions from the hierarchical approaches are reliable and provide on average better results than non-hierarchical ones. Conclusions SDMs can be valuable tools for local plant conservation programs. We present examples of the applicability of a hierarchical modeling approach and conceptual and methodological solutions related to the use of these tools in local vegetation conservation programs. For example, we show that landscape SDMs could be used to determine the current distribution of endangered plant species, while a hierarchical approach would be better suited to define areas to re-vegetate within a local restoration program.","[Mateo, Ruben G.; Gaston, Aitor; Jose Aroca-Fernandez, Maria; Saura, Santiago; Ignacio Garcia-Vinas, Juan] Univ Politecn Madrid, MONTES ETSI Montes Forestal & Medio Nat, Madrid, Spain; [Mateo, Ruben G.] Univ Autonoma Madrid, Dept Biol Bot, Madrid, Spain; [Mateo, Ruben G.] UAM, CIBC, Ctr Invest Biodiversidad & Cambio Global, Madrid, Spain; [Broennimann, Olivier; Guisan, Antoine] Univ Lausanne, Dept Ecol & Evolut, Lausanne, Switzerland; [Broennimann, Olivier; Guisan, Antoine] Univ Lausanne, Inst Earth Surface Dynam, Lausanne, Switzerland; [Saura, Santiago] European Commiss, JRC, Ispra, Italy",rubeng.mateo@uam.es,78,11,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1100-9233,J VEG SCI,J.

The absence of species-specific information on catch, life history and migration of skates has often precluded the development of single-species stock assessments and led to the use of cursory multispecies assessments, which lack the ability to track species-specific catch and abundance trends. This has resulted in undetected local extirpations, as has been previously reported for common (Dipturus batis, Rajidae), white (Rostroraja alba, Rajidae) and long-nose (Dipturus oxyrhinchus, Rajidae) skates in the Irish Sea. Here, we (a) use case studies to illustrate how the perception of skate population structure and stock status has historically been masked through multispecies assessment and management practices, (b) review current information on the movement of skates and identify gaps in knowledge, and (c) identify biases associated with the use of various tagging technologies, which have confounded our understanding of movement and migration ecology of skates. Considering that over 40% of extant Rajidae species are listed as Data Deficient by the International Union for Conservation of Nature, we illustrate a critical need to broaden the current understanding of skate life history, movement and migration ecology by providing recommendations on the further application of electronic tags and biogeochemical natural tags in movement studies and highlight the benefits that studies using these approaches have for novel management frameworks.","[Siskey, Matthew R.; Shipley, Oliver N.; Frisk, Michael G.] SUNY Stony Brook, Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA",matthew.siskey@stonybrook.edu,127,12,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1467-2960,FISH FISH,Fish.

This study was conducted to assess the available rainwater that can be harvested in a conserved catchment in a drought prone agro-ecological zone. The study was carried out in the Cyili sub-catchment, southern province of Rwanda, which has an irregular rainfall pattern and unexploited runoff water. Soil Conservation Service-Curve Number method (SCS-CN), CROPWAT model version 8 and Hazen model with an average daily rainfall data recorded from 1971 to 2016 were applied to estimate the runoff and water requirements in the study area. Findings of the study revealed that more than half rainfall water received in the catchment was lost through runoff (229.8 mm) and effective rainfall was lower (246.9 mm) than the actual crop water requirement for maize (330 mm). The expected seasonal surface runoff volume to be harvested by the farmers was 3008 m(3) ha(-1) per season and 1.29 x 10(6) m(3) per season for the entire whole sub-catchment (430 ha). Based on Hazen model, the return period of low rainfall (dry spell) event would be expected every 2 years with a 98% probability of occurrence. Cyili sub-catchment has higher potential runoff volume to stabilize the deficit of water demand in the period of short rainy season. This suggests that rainwater harvesting through supplementary irrigation is an option to improve the crop yield in the dry period as well as in the annual dry season.

Integrating evolution with ecology extends the scope of testing the frameworks of these hypotheses. We test diversification hypotheses by integrating phylogeography and ecological niche models (ENMs) using the rodent Hylaeamys megacephalus (Azara's broad-headed oryzomys or large headed rice rat) of the Amazon and dry forests, as a model. We estimated divergence times, ancestral areas, diversification events, historical demography, haplotype sharing, and genetic distances based on the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene. We generated ENMs and tested for niche divergence between lineages; integrated genetic data to predict gene flow corridors; and projected paleodistributions for comparison with historical demography. We found high structuring in northern Amazonia on the left bank of the Amazon River, and less structure but secondary contact in southern Amazonia and dry forests. The Northern Amazonian lineage diverged from the other lineages through dispersal followed by vicariance due to the Amazon River about 1.35Mya, while the Southern Amazonian and Cerrado lineages diverged through dispersal about 0.78 Mya. Paleodistribution models revealed expansions of dry forest lineages consistent with the Refugia Hypothesis, but not retraction for the humid forest lineage, which were not congruent with historical demography data. Niche divergence was not supported for the Northern Amazonian lineage, whereas habitat corridors linking current lineages suggest environmental continuity to their distributions that is concordant with a riverine barrier. In contrast, niche divergence was supported between the Southern Amazonian and Cerrado lineages, indicating that isolation followed by ecological divergence likely acted on this diversification. The recent Amazon River barrier and ecological differentiation observed here will surely provide insight for future studies and hypotheses of biodiversity diversification in the Neotropics. Studies that integrate evolution and ecology promise to disentangle alternative hypotheses and shed light on the biogeography of this megadiverse region.","[Machado, Arielli Fabricio; dos Santos, Marcelo Augusto, Jr.] Inst Nacl Pesquisas Amazonia INPA, Programa Posgrad Ecol, Manaus, Amazonas, Brazil; [Nunes, Mario Silva; Farias, Izeni Pires] Univ Fed Amazonas UFAM, Lab Evolucao & Genet Anim LEGAL, Manaus, Amazonas, Brazil; [Ferreira da Silva, Maria Nazareth; Anciaes, Marina] Inst Nacl Pesquisas Amazonia INPA, Coordenacao Pesquisas Biodiversidade COBIO & Cole, Manaus, Amazonas, Brazil; [Silva, Claudia Regina] Inst Nacl Pesquisas Amazonia INPA, Programa Posgrad Genet Conservacao & Biol Evolut, Manaus, Amazonas, Brazil; [Silva, Claudia Regina] Inst Pesquisas Cient & Tecnol Estado Amapa IEPA, Lab Mamiferos, Macapa, AP, Brazil; [Machado, Arielli Fabricio] Phylogenet & Funct Ecol Lab LEFF, Av Bento Goncalves 9500,Bldg 43-113, BR-91501970 Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil",ariellifm@gmail.com,136,6,6,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0269-7653,EVOL ECOL,Evol.

The main aim of this study was to assess if such ecological bioindicator species could be identified within Afromontane grassland avifauna that would be used for monitoring the effects of livestock grazing on ecosystem in the Bale Mountains of Ethiopia. We collected data on birds and vegetation structure along 14 transects each in the light (protected) and heavy (unprotected) grazing sites in June 2014 (referred to as the first sampling period) and in December 2014 (the second sampling period). Then, we (i) initially identified potential bioindicator species for the light grazing site, based on data collected during the first sampling period; (ii) examined relationships between abundance of these bioindicators and level of grazing pressure; (iii) tested the consistency of those initially selected bioindicator species, based on independent data collected during the second sampling period. We used the Indicator Value (IndVal) Analysis method to identify bioindicator species for the light grazing site. Species with significant IndVal>60% were considered as potential bioindicator for the site compared to the heavy grazing site. Six species were initially identified as potential bioindicators from the first sampling period dataset, and four of these species were again consistently identified from the second sampling period. Furthermore, abundance of the bioindicators had significantly declined with increasing grazing pressure, but positively correlated with four habitat variables (i.e. heights of shrub, herb and grass, and cover of shrub). These findings suggest that those consistently identified four species represent suite of reliable bioindicators that can successfully be used for monitoring of changes in habitat structure in the site.

The Pacific Coast of Mexico (PCM) is inhabited by 62 known species (or 12%) of living sharks, which belong to 21 families and 34 genera. We divide the Pacific Coast of Mexico (PCM) into four regions for consideration: (1) the western coast of Baja California (WcBJ), (2) the Gulf of California (GC), (3) the Central Pacific Mexican (CPM), and (4) the Gulf of Tehuantepec (GT). Biodiversity is highest in the GC, with 48 shark species, followed by the WcBJ with 44 species, then the CPM with 28 species and the GT with 26 species. Few large species (>2m in total length) function as top predators in any region, with a greater number of smaller shark species (<1.5m total length). Information about the trophic ecology of different shark species is included to know the ecological role and position of each shark species within a food web to understand the dynamics of marine communities and the impact that each species has on trophic net, which is critical to effective resource conservation and responsible exploitation. The different shark species predate mainly on coastal or oceanic waters. The coastal sharks feed mainly on crustaceans and small fishes; whereas the oceanic species predate mainly on squids and fishes from mesopelagic to epipelagic habits.

The Neretva nase, Chondrostoma knerii Heckel, 1843, is an endemic cyprinid species distributed in the Neretva River basin in Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina, designated in the EU Habitats Directive as a species requiring conservation within member states. According to the IUCN, the species is catalogued as vulnerable (VU). Available scientific data indicate that significant aspects of its biological and ecological characteristics, as well as conservation requirements, are scarce and largely composed of outdated records. This paper provides a summary of the main life history traits, particularly those related to the conservation challenges and a detailed list of the current state of knowledge. Material and methods. This review was based on published literature in the form of research articles, monographs, books and technical reports, as well as unpublished data Results. All available data were organized, critically analysed and presented in a comprehensive form. Issues related to species conservation were highlighted with respect to the impact of development activities. The long-term monitoring data of reproduction activity in the Hutovo Blato wetland were presented, showing the lowering of spring inflow capacity as the major factors for spawning success.

In addition to meeting the demand of social economy development, the protection and improvement of eco-environment should be taken into account. As the link between water use for human activities and natural water cycle, it is necessary to research on the ecological effect of water conservancy projects. From the perspective of whether to be affected by human activities, ecological effect is divided into natural ecological effect and social ecological effect, a framework of comprehensive evaluation index system for ecological effect is preliminarily constructed. The concept of ecological effect of water conservancy projects is analysed, and three-level ecological effects of water conservancy projects are presented. The three-level evaluation index system for ecological effect of water conservancy projects is built based on the hydrological regime analysis. The quantitative evaluation can be achieved. The method is applied to evaluate the ecological effect of large-scale water conservancy projects in the Weihe River Basin. The results show that the index system is of high applicability, which provides scientific basis for the quantitative evaluation for ecological effect of water conservancy projects and offers a better support to healthy development of river ecosystems.","[Wei, N.; Xie, J.

In 1997, the Mexican government implemented a policy of conservation and sustainable use of wildlife units (called UMAs, by their Spanish acronym) that comprises intensive and free-living management. Since then, no national or regional assessments have been conducted to estimate impacts and benefits even with 5529 registered UMAs now covering almost 20% of the national territory. The objective of this study was to characterize the SUMA (UMAs System) in a regional context in three states of southeastern Mexico. The impact of UMAs was studied in depth through a selection of representative case studies: three species of mangrove (Avicennia germinans, Laguncularia racemosa and Rhizophora mangle), ponytail palm (Beaucarnea recurvata), red cedar (Cedrela odorata) and white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), and a connectivity analysis, in order to evaluate the contribution of the UMAs to the conservation of species and ecosystems. The number of active UMAs at regional scale was 834, managing 273 species; 7.1% of the UMAs manage nationally-prioritized species, while 8.3% and 94.3% manage endemic and native species, respectively. Conservation of ecosystems has been successfully achieved through the UMAs that manage mangrove and white-tailed deer. We propose to promote the establishment of free-living UMAs that would contribute to increase the conservation areas. Finally, we highlight the relevance of regional-scale spatial analysis as an important tool for improving environmental policy and conservation strategies.","[Alvarez-Peredo, Carolina; Contreras-Hernandez, Armando] Inst Ecol AC, Red Ambiente & Sustentabilidad, Carretera Antigua Coatepec 351, Xalapa 91070, Veracruz, Mexico; [Gallina-Tessaro, Sonia] Inst Ecol AC, Red Biol & Conservac Vertebrados, Carretera Antigua Coatepec 351, Xalapa 91070, Veracruz, Mexico; [Pineda-Vazquez, Mariana; Ortega-Argueta, Alejandro] El Colegio Frontera Sur, Unidad San Cristobal, Dept Conservac Biodiversidad, Carret Panamer & Perifer S-N, San Cristobal Las Casas 29290, Chiapas, Mexico; [Tejeda-Cruz, Carlos] Univ Autonoma Chiapas, Fac Med Vet & Zootecnia, Carretera Teran Emiliano Zapata Km 8, Tuxtla Gutierrez 29050, Chiapas, Mexico; [Landgrave, Rosario] Inst Ecol AC, Red Ecol Func, Carretera Antigua Coatepec 351, Xalapa 91070, Veracruz, Mexico",caroalvarez84@yahoo.com; armando.contreras@inecol.mx; sonia.gallina@inecol.mx; mapineda@ecosur.edu.mx; aortega@ecosur.mx; ctejedacruz@gmail.com; rosario.landgrave@inecol.mx,82,2,3,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,2018,"gold, Green Submitted",

An example is logistic growth, modeling the effects of intraspecific competition, while the Lotka-Volterra equations for competition extend this to systems of multiple species, with varying strengths of intra- and interspecific competition. These equations are a classic and well-used staple of quantitative ecology, providing a framework to understand species interactions, species coexistence, and community assembly. They can be derived from an assumption of random mixing of organisms, and an outcome of each interaction that removes one or more individuals. However, this framing is somewhat unsatisfactory, and ecologists may prefer to think of phenomenological equations for competition as deriving from competition for a set of resources required for growth, which in turn may undergo their own complex dynamics. While it is intuitive that these frameworks are connected, and the connection is well-understood near to equilibria, here, we ask the question: when can consumer dynamics alone become an exact description of a full system of consumers and resources? We identify that consumer-resource systems with this property must have some kind of redundancy in the original description, or equivalently there is one or more conservation laws for quantities that do not change with time. Such systems are known in mathematics as integrable systems. We suggest that integrability in consumer-resource dynamics can only arise in cases where each species in an assemblage requires a distinct and unique combination of resources, and even in these cases, it is not clear that the resulting dynamics will lead to Lotka-Volterra competition.","[O'Dwyer, James P.] Univ Illinois, Dept Plant Biol, Urbana, IL 61801 USA",jodwyer@illinois.edu,42,13,13,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1874-1738,THEOR ECOL-NETH,Theor.

The open crop residue burning resulted in several environmental consequences which have impending influence in the present climate change scenario. In addition to the massive greenhouse gases and particulate emissions, degrading soil ecological health is another pertinent issue which needs special attention of the scientific community for achieving agricultural sustainability. Several agronomic advancements have been done in recent decades to overcome these challenges. Among the major developments for crop residue management, conservation agriculture practices have been advocated as a pronounced measure to accomplish the core objectives of smart agricultural practices. Crop residue management is an inherent component of the conservation agriculture practices which has its multifaceted risks and benefits. However, depending on the monetary benefits and short time span between the two crops, the farmers used to compromise with the crop residue retention principle of conservation agriculture. Therefore, it is imperative to explore the ecological role played by crop residue under the conservation agriculture systems. In this review, an effort has been made to collate the studies describing the ecological role of crop residue in conservation agriculture practices. In the first part of the review, we have given a brief emphasis on the crop residue availability, its composition and fate under the conventional agriculture system. In the latter half, a critical insight has been given on the status of crop residue in the conservation agriculture system and its possible risks and benefits under the climate change scenario. Overall, the crop residue played an important role in improving soil physico-chemical and biological properties, and there is a need to strike the balance between the residue generation and its proper utilization under the conservation agriculture systems.","[Singh, Shikha; Singh, Rishikesh; Upadhyay, Shweta; Raghubanshi, Akhilesh Singh] Banaras Hindu Univ, Integrat Ecol Lab IEL, Inst Environm & Sustainable Dev IESD, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India; [Mishra, Ajay Kumar] Kyoto Univ, Terr Ecosyst Management Lab, Grad Sch Global Environm Studies, Kyoto, Japan; [Mishra, Ajay Kumar] Banaras Hindu Univ, Inst Sci, Dept Bot, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India",asr.iesd.bhu@gmail.com,86,1,1,SCIENTIFIC PUBLISHERS,JODHPUR,"5A, NEW PALI RD, JODHPUR, RAJASTHAN 342 001, INDIA",0564-3295,TROP ECOL,Trop.

However, anthropogenic activities and climate change impacts are driving changes in the distributions and population dynamics of these animals, with negative consequences for ecosystem functioning. Across mid-latitude shelf-seas marine mammals and seabirds are known to forage across a number of oceanographic habitats that structure the spatio-temporal distributions of prey fields. Knowledge of these and the bio-physical mechanisms driving such associations are needed to improve marine management and policy. Here, we provide a concise and easily accessible guide for both researchers and managers of marine systems on the predominant oceanographic habitats that are favoured for foraging by marine mammals and seabirds across mid-latitude shelf-seas. We (1) identify and describe key discrete physical features present across the continental shelf, working inshore from the shelf-edge to the shore line, (2) provide an overview of findings relating to associations between these habitats and marine mammals and seabirds, (3) identify areas for future research and (4) discuss the relevance of such information to conservation management. We show that oceanographic features preferentially foraged at by marine mammals and seabirds include shelf edge fronts, upwelling and tidal-mixing fronts, offshore banks and internal waves, regions of stratification, and topographically complex coastal areas subject to strong tidal flow. Whilst associations were variable across taxa and through space and time, in the majority of cases interactions between bathymetry and tidal currents appear to play a dominant role, alongside patterns in seasonal stratification and shelf-edge upwelling. We suggest that the ecological significance of these bio-physical structures stems from a capacity to alter the densities, distributions (both horizontally and vertically) and/or behaviours of prey in a persistent and/or predictable manner that increases accessibility for predators, and likely enhances foraging efficiency. Future conservation management should aim to preserve and protect these habitats. This will require adaptive and holistic strategies that are specifically tailored to the characteristics of an oceanographic feature, and where necessary, evolve through space and time in response to spatio-temporal variability. Improved monitoring of animal movements and biophysical conditions across shelf-seas would aid in this. Areas for future research include multi-disciplinary/ trophic studies of the mechanisms linking bio-physical processes, prey and marine mammals and seabirds (which may elucidate the importance of lesser studied features such as bottom fronts and Langmuir circulation cells), alongside a better understanding of how predators perceive their environment and develop foraging strategies during immature/juvenile stages. Estimates of the importance of oceanographic habitat features at a population level should also be obtained. Such information is vital to ensuring the future health of these complex ecosystems, and can be used to assess how anthropogenic activities and future environmental changes will impact the functioning and spatio-temporal dynamics of these bio-physical features and their use by marine predators.","[Cox, S.

To cope with the multiple challenges related to global change but also to further improve forest management we need a better understanding of (1) the linkages between drivers of ecosystem change and the state and management of forest ecosystems as well as their capacity to adapt to ongoing global environmental changes, and (2) the interrelationships within and between the components of forest ecosystems. To address the resulting challenges for the state of forest ecosystems in Central Europe, we suggest 45 questions for future ecological research. We define forest ecology as studies on the abiotic and biotic components of forest ecosystems and their interactions on varying spatial and temporal scales. Our questions cover five thematic fields and correspond to the criteria selected for describing the state of Europe's forests by policy makers, i.e. biogeochemical cycling, mortality and disturbances, productivity, biodiversity and biotic interactions, and regulation and protection. We conclude that an improved mechanistic understanding of forest ecosystems is essential for the further development of ecosystem-oriented multifunctional forest management in the face of accelerating global change.

The WMAs consist of multiple villages designating land and managing it for wildlife conservation in return for a portion of subsequent tourism revenues. The ecological success or failure of WMAs for wildlife conservation is rarely quantified but is important for evaluating the efficacy of specific projects and the general concept of CBNRM. I used 3 analyses to evaluate the ecological effectiveness of wildlife conservation actions in the Burunge WMA. I compared wildlife and livestock densities inside and outside a WMA using 1 year of distance sampling data and compared wild and domestic ungulate densities before and after the implementation of management changes that increased wildlife protections within a subsection of Burunge WMA using 6 years of distance sampling surveys. I also compared giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis) survival and population growth rate before and after the implementation of management changes that increased wildlife protections in a subsection of Burunge WMA using 5 years of photographic capture-recapture data. I found greater densities of wildlife and lower densities of livestock inside the WMA compared with outside. After the management changes, I documented significantly higher densities of several wild ungulate species and lower densities of domestic ungulates in the WMA. I found giraffe survival and population growth rate both increased in response to the management changes. Results indicated the WMA is effectively providing habitat and protection for wild ungulates while generally excluding domestic livestock. Ungulate densities, and giraffe survival and population growth rate over time indicated the management changes enacted in 2014-2015 resulted in positive effects for wild ungulates. These combined results indicate the ecological effectiveness of Burunge WMA and provide evidence that CBNRM can have positive effects on wildlife populations, particularly when support to grassroots law enforcement is provided.

A common mitigation response is the construction and upgrade of hard coastal protection structures, such as breakwaters, seawalls, and groynes. The alteration of the coast, together with the introduction of novel materials into coastal waters can negatively impact adjacent habitats and associated organisms. The implementation of management plans that involve scientists, as well as a variety of other stakeholders offer an opportunity to minimise adverse effects to biodiversity or even enhance it, while still protecting infrastructure and people. This study examines the management of an Australian breakwater upgrade and the progressive design finding process, including stakeholder engagement, determination of assessment criteria, and environmental impact assessment. In the course of the latter, scientific research led to the rediscovery of a presumed extinct algal species, Nereia lophocladia, which created an additional challenge and temporarily halted the upgrade. To accommodate this, the breakwater design solution was modified to avoid any impacts on the algal population and, in order to maximise the species' survival, novel ecological engineering approaches were proposed as mitigation strategies.

In this article, I argue that ethnoprimatological research can meet this goal only by discarding the purely science views of conservation that dominate the current literature. By considering more than local ecological perceptions, their ideological agendas, and their levels of power via a political ecology framework, ethnoprimatologists can simultaneously socialize the ecosystems we study and contribute our ethological skills to advance traditionally humanist disciplines' increased attention to a wider field of agents and structures that matter. I support these arguments through an examination of farmer-green monkey (Chlorocebus sabaeus) relations in St. Kitts. Kittitian farmers' narrative revealed three scales that collectively construct what is locally known as the monkey problem: increased rates of local contact between farmers and monkeys on farms, contestations over the future of St. Kitts' land, and global debates over appropriate strategies to manage the monkey population. I show that although the monkey problem in St. Kitts does not involve an endangered or threatened species, my analysis of this construct has implications for primate populations that are threatened.

However, there is a generalized lack of information about how biosphere reserves are being managed and governed, and at what point their goals are being achieved, which limits a better understanding of the factors influencing biosphere reserve management effectiveness. Building on a systematic review of existing empirical studies, we developed a framework that identifies the main features related to biosphere reserve management effectiveness. We identified four main categories-context, inputs, process and outcomes-and 53 sub-categories, which interact at different scales and shape biosphere reserve effectiveness. We found that the capacity of biosphere reserves to achieve their goals is not only related to the way they are managed/governed, or to the inputs invested, but to many social and ecological contextual factors. We also identified benefits and impacts that were associated to biosphere reserves around the world. Comparing to other social-ecological system frameworks, ours provides a more inclusive approach, since it integrates the findings of studies with different research perspectives, considers a plurality of values attributed to natural resources, and the social-ecological system's scales dynamics.","[Ferreira, Ana F.; Santos, Rui] NOVA Univ Lisbon, NOVA Sch Sci & Technol, Ctr Environm & Sustainabil Res CENSE, Campus Caparica, P-2829516 Caparica, Portugal; [Ferreira, Ana F.; von Wehrden, Henrik] Leuphana Univ, Fac Sustainabil, Inst Ecol, Univ Allee 1, D-21335 Luneburg, Germany; [Ferreira, Ana F.; von Wehrden, Henrik] Leuphana Univ, Ctr Methods, Univ Allee 1, D-21335 Luneburg, Germany; [Zimmermann, Heike] Leuphana Univ, Fac Sustainabil, Inst Eth & Transdisciplinary Sustainabil Res, Univ Allee 1, D-21335 Luneburg, Germany",afdinisferreira@gmail.com; heike.zimmermann@leuphana.de; rfs@fct.unl.pt; henrik.von_wehrden@leuphana.de,77,9,9,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,2018,"Green Submitted, gold",

Thus, this discipline also holds great promise for improving the conservation of wildlife. To measure progress toward this promise, we investigated the degree to which movement ecology research is connected to conservation goals as well as the proportion of studies that were incorporated into federal and international status assessments for mobile species at risk. We examined 13,349 movement ecology papers published between 1990 and 2014 and found that explicit connections to conservation and management were made in 35% (n = 4, 672) of these papers, with the number of connections increasing over time. We then measured the uptake of movement ecology research into species status assessment and recovery plans (n = 72 documents) produced by three different governance agencies for 12 endangered mobile species. We found that on average 60% of available movement ecology research was used in the status assessment process, demonstrating that when movement ecology research is available, it is generally being utilized in conservation planning. However, for 25% of these species, there was little movement research available to be used, highlighting that knowledge gaps remain for some at-risk species despite the general growth of movement ecology research.

The influence of the National Program for the Conservation of Sea Turtles on the fishermen's perception of and attitudes towards sea turtles were also evaluated. The results based in 80 interviews showed that the green turtle (Chelonia mydas) is the species most frequently observed and incidentally captured in bottom trawl nets, gillnets and fishing lines along the region. In general, fishermen know about occurrence and preferential diet of the sea turtles along the study area. Fishing and pollution were the main threats. In SFI and FST (where the Program is present) and in CF (where the Program is absent), most interviewees reported that when the capture occurs and the sea turtle 'appears' to be dead, they release it immediately in the sea, which is bad for turtles as they may drown. In ATF (where the Program is absent), most interviewees reported that they attempt to resuscitate the sea turtle when it 'appears' to be dead. The 15 + year presence of the Program in the region (SFI and FST) and its local strategies have discrete influence about fishermen's perception of and attitudes towards sea turtles; instead, knowledge of sea turtles derives from regional fishing practices. This study proposes redirecting the Program's strategies so that the fishing communities act as local conservation agents.","[Awabdi, Danielle Rodrigues; Tavares, Davi Castro; Madeira Di Beneditto, Ana Paula] Univ Estadual Norte Fluminense, Lab Ciencias Ambientais, Av Alberto Lamego 2000, BR-28013600 Campos Das Goytacazes, RJ, Brazil; [Vigliar Bondioli, Ana Cristina] Fac Eniac, Nucleo Pesquisas Eniac, Rua Forca Publ 89, BR-07012030 Guarulhos, SP, Brazil; [Zappes, Camilah Antunes] Univ Fed Fluminense, Dept Geog Campos, Rua Jose Patrocinio 71, BR-28010385 Campos Das Goytacazes, RJ, Brazil",awabdi.dani@gmail.com,111,9,9,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-597X,MAR POLICY,Mar.

The experiment was conducted in Cyili sub-catchment in Southern Province of Rwanda, which has an irregular rainfall distribution and a prolonged dry season. The experimental design consisted of a randomized design and each treatment was replicated three times. Findings from this study revealed that maize grain yield and yield components, such as plant height, cob diameter and length, number of leaves, 100 grain weight, and yield per plant were highly significantly affected (P < 0.001) by all water conservation methods tested. Only germination rate was not significantly impacted (p > 0.05). Supplementary irrigation treatment increased maize yield production to 11,982 kg ha(-1). Mulching increased yield significantly to 8089 kg ha(-1). Ridges yielded 5937 kg ha(-1), and rainfed treatment yielded 4755 kg ha(-1) of maize. Based on Pearson's correlation coefficients, grain yield and yield components were positively correlated and statistically significant (p < 0.001) under various water conservation methods. Supplementary irrigation through rainwater harvesting was found to be a more promising option for maize growers to mitigate dry spell and stabilize maize production in rainfall deficient agro-ecological conditions not only in Rwanda, but in sub-Sahara Africa.

However, few studies take into consideration the interconnected relationship between the social processes underpinning knowledge accumulation, generation and transmission. The study draws on ethnobotanical research to explore plant uses, practices and belief systems developed among the indigenous Vhavenda in South Africa for sustaining indigenous plant resources and highlights some of the forces of change influencing the acquisition and transmission of knowledge. Methods: Data was collected from September-November 2016 from 31 individuals by means of semi-structured interviews; walks in home gardens, cultivated fields, montane forests and deciduous woodlands; and vouchering of plant species in six villages (Duthuni, Tshidzivhe, Vuvha, Lwamondo, Mashau and Tshiendeulu) in the Vhembe District of South Africa. The Use Value Index (UVI) was used to measure the number of different uses of each species and the Relative Frequency Index (RFI) to measure the local importance of each species. Semi-structured interviews and comparisons with published works also explored cultural practices and belief systems associated with plants, modes and barriers of knowledge transmission. Results: Eighty-four plant species were reported within 44 families, with Fabaceae representing the highest diversity of plant species. We identified six species not previously documented in the Vhavenda ethnobotanical literature, 68 novel uses of plants and another 14 variations of known uses. Vhavenda plants were predominantly used for food (36.0%) and medicine (26.1%) and consisted mainly of native (73.8%) compared to non-native species (26.2%). The Vhavenda possess a range of practices for managing plant resources that can be attributed to taboos preventing the use of selected species, promotion of sustainable harvesting practices and the propagation of plant species for ecological restoration. Plant knowledge and management practices were transmitted from relatives (48.4%), self-taught through time spent planting and harvesting plants on the land (19.4%), through apprenticeships with traditional healers (16.1%), initiation schools (9. 7%) and clan gatherings (6.4%). Changes in traditional learning platforms for knowledge exchange, erosion of cultural institutions and shifting value systems serve as barriers for knowledge transmission among the Vhavenda. Conclusion: The study points to a need for new partnerships to be forged between conservationists, government actors and local and indigenous knowledge holders to foster hybrid knowledge coproduction for developing strategies to enhance the productivity and biodiversity of indigenous lands.","[Constant, Natasha Louise] Univ Venda, Sch Math & Nat Sci, SARChI Chair Biodivers Value & Change, Private Bag X5050, ZA-0950 Thohoyandou, South Africa; [Constant, Natasha Louise] Cardiff Univ, Sustainable Places Res Inst, 33 Pk Pl, Cardiff CF10 3BA, S Glam, Wales; [Tshisikhawe, Milingoni Peter] Univ Venda, Sch Math & Nat Sci, Dept Bot, Private Bag X5050, ZA-0950 Thohoyandou, South Africa",constantn@cardiff.ac.uk,60,14,14,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",1746-4269,J ETHNOBIOL ETHNOMED,J.

Terrestrial mixed-species bird flocks (hereafter, TMSF) represent one such potential system: they form throughout the world, and in most cases have an asymmetric organization in which one or a few species play 'nuclear' roles, being particularly important for flock formation or maintenance. A quantitative study on the distribution of TMSF and how they respond to anthropogenic disturbance (AD) is still, however, needed. We surveyed 201 publications on terrestrial TMSF worldwide, finding that 19% of the world's bird species participate in them, including 158 threatened species, with tropical species dominating these lists. Of 31 TMSF studies that investigated AD, 22 showed significant declines in some metric, with TMSF in more impacted areas including 1/4 fewer species, and 1/3 fewer individuals. In 13/15 studies, TMSF were more sensitive to AD than the overall bird community. We conceptualize the reasons behind this response: first, AD directly influences drivers of flocking (predation, foraging), and second, AD produces changes in community composition that affect TMSF, such as when the extirpation or reduction of nuclear species affects other species' participation. We rank nuclear species globally by their consistency of leadership and number of followers, suggesting that these species' interactive roles be considered as part of their conservation value, and further that conserving TMSF provides an efficient mechanism to ensure the protection of many species simultaneously.","[Zou, Fasheng; Zhang, Min; Zhang, Qiang] Guangdong Inst Appl Biol Resources, Guangdong Key Lab Anim Conservat & Resource Utili, Guangdong Publ Lab Wild Anim Conservat & Utilizat, Guangzhou 510260, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Jones, Harrison; Sieving, Kathryn] Univ Florida, Dept Wildlife Ecol, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Colorado, Gabriel J.

To explore the role of ecorestoration efforts within forest-wetland ecosystem in conserving biodiversity and maintaining the sustained flow of ES, the multi-decadal recovery of a degraded landscape of Gurguripal forest, West Bengal, India, was tracked with the help of geospatial technology and field surveys of biodiversity and socio-ecological bonds. To evidence the noticeable recovery of the study site over 25 years remote sensing (RS) techniques were used to track forest type and land use land cover (LULC) changes over time, together with an ecological monitoring at site of the sal dominated tropical deciduous forest and the created wetland ecosystems using ground truth data on vegetation, floral and faunal diversity, physicochemical parameters of water and soil, etc. and socio-ecological survey do depict existing ecosystem services (ES) of these ecosystems. The study confirms positive effects of watershed management initiated by the Forest Department, Government of West Bengal, involving local people ultimately causing reduction in the proportion of degraded land and an increase in green coverage that has been strikingly manifested through retaining surface water. In spite of the lower incidence of terrestrial fauna inside the core of secondary forest with respect to fringe areas, the wetlands, so formed, not only serve as vital perennial water sources in this drought-prone lateritic tract and enrich aquatic biodiversity, but also multifariously multiply the value of ES in this otherwise degrading piece of land.

Population dynamics and foraging ecology are two fields of the population ecology that are generally studied separately. Yet, foraging determines allocation processes and therefore demography. Studies on wandering albatrosses Diomedea exulans over the past 50years have contributed to better understand the links between population dynamics and foraging ecology. This article reviews how these two facets of population ecology have been combined to better understand ecological processes, but also have contributed fundamentally for the conservation of this long-lived threatened species. 2. Wandering albatross research has combined a 50-year long-term study of marked individuals with two decades of tracking studies that have been initiated on this species, favoured by its large size and tameness. 3. At all stages of their life history, the body mass of individuals plays a central role in allocation processes, in particular in influencing adult and juvenile survival, decisions to recruit into the population or to invest into provisioning the offspring or into maintenance. 4. Strong age-related variations in demographic parameters are observed and are linked to age-related differences in foraging distribution and efficiency. Marked sex-specific differences in foraging distribution, foraging efficiency and changes in mass over lifetime are directly related to the strong sex-specific investment in breeding and survival trajectories of the two sexes, with body mass playing a pivotal role especially in males. 5. Long-term study has allowed determining the sex-specific and age-specific demographic causes of population decline, and the tracking studies have been able to derive where and how these impacts occur, in particular the role of long-line fisheries.","[Weimerskirch, Henri] Univ La Rochelle, CNRS, UMR 7372, Ctr Etud Biol Chize, Villiers En Bois, France",henri.weimerskirch@cebc.cnrs.fr,69,19,19,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8790,J ANIM ECOL,J.

In forest ecosystems, deadwood-dependent organisms (i.e., saproxylics) are negatively affected by forest management and degradation globally. We reviewed empirically established dispersal ecology of saproxylic insects and fungi. We focused on direct studies (e.g., mark-recapture, radiotelemetry), field experiments, and population genetic analyses. We found 2 somewhat opposite results. Based on direct methods and experiments, dispersal is limited to within a few kilometers, whereas genetic studies showed little genetic structure over tens of kilometers, which indicates long-distance dispersal. The extent of direct dispersal studies and field experiments was small and thus these studies could not have detected long-distance dispersal. Particularly for fungi, more studies at management-relevant scales (1-10 km) are needed. Genetic researchers used outdated markers, investigated few loci, and faced the inherent difficulties of inferring dispersal from genetic population structure. Although there were systematic and species-specific differences in dispersal ability (fungi are better dispersers than insects), it seems that for both groups colonization and establishment, not dispersal per se, are limiting their occurrence at management-relevant scales. Because most studies were on forest landscapes in Europe, particularly the boreal region, more data are needed from nonforested landscapes in which fragmentation effects are likely to be more pronounced. Given the potential for long-distance dispersal and the logical necessity of habitat area being a more fundamental landscape attribute than the spatial arrangement of habitat patches (i.e., connectivity sensu strict), retaining high-quality deadwood habitat is more important for saproxylic insects and fungi than explicit connectivity conservation in many cases.","[Komonen, Atte] Univ Jyvaskyla, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, POB 35, FI-40014 Jyvaskyla, Finland; [Mueller, Jorg] Bavarian Forest Natl Pk,Freyunger Str 2, D-94481 Grafenau, Germany; [Mueller, Jorg] Univ Wurzburg, Dept Anim Ecol & Trop Biol, Bioctr, Field Stn Fabrikschleichach, Glashuttenstr 5, D-96181 Rauhenebrach, Germany",atte.komonen@jyu.fi,88,41,41,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0888-8892,CONSERV BIOL,Conserv.

This study investigated the late Holocene vegetation history of a present-day pinewood in western Ireland, to test the widely accepted hypothesis that P. sylvestris became extinct in Ireland c. AD 400. Palaeoecological, chronological and loss-on-ignition analyses were conducted on a sediment core extracted from an adjacent lake. The pollen profile showed no major Pinus decline and a Pinus macrofossil occurred c. AD 840, indicating localised survival of P. sylvestris from c. AD 350 to the present. The available archival maps and historical literature provide supporting evidence for continuity of forest cover. The hypothesis that P. sylvestris became extinct in Ireland is rejected. The implications for ecological management are significant. We argue that P. sylvestris should be considered native to Ireland, at least at this site. As Ireland's only putative native P. sylvestris population and the western limit of the species' native range, this site is of high conservation value and must be carefully managed and monitored. Seed-sourcing for ex-situ forest restoration must be compatible with the long-term viability of the population in-situ.","[Roche, Jenni R.] Dublin City Council, Pk & Landscape Serv Div, Dublin Bay Biosphere Partnership, Civic Offices, Dublin 8, Ireland; [Roche, Jenni R.; Mitchell, Fraser J.

However, scarce information on their distributions in Southeast Asia is impairing conservation efforts. In this study, we sought to improve our understanding of the geographical range and distinct populations of the three Asian horseshoe crabs species in order to identify optimal conservation areas. We mapped the geographic range of Carcinoscorpius rotundicauda, Tachypleus gigas, and T tridentatus using recent data from field work, literature, Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF), and unpublished data from our scientific network. The data were correlated with 23 different environmental variables of potential ecological importance for horseshoe crabs using the openModeller webservices, including new tidal variables. Ecological niche models were generated using two algorithms, Maximum Entropy and support vector machine, for the three species under present conditions, and projected into a climate change scenario of 2050. The niches of the Asian horseshoe crabs were mostly determined by tidal regime, chlorophyll A concentrations, depth, distance to land, and sea surface temperature. According to our predictions, horseshoe crabs in Southeast Asia are not expected to experience any severe change in extent and distribution of suitable habitat in the future. In order to conserve Asian horseshoe crabs, we suggest establishing Marine Protected Areas at locations where distinct populations and several species occur, such as northern Vietnam, China, Borneo, and southern Japan.","[Vestbo, Stine; Funch, Peter] Aarhus Univ, Dept Biosci, Genet Ecol & Evolut, Aarhus, Denmark; [Obst, Matthias] Univ Gothenburg, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, Gothenburg, Sweden; [Fernandez, Francisco J.

We assumed that the nesting data stemmed from a single, unhabituated community at the Bagnomba hill site in the savanna-woodlands of southeastern Senegal. The aim of this study was to examine chimpanzees' nesting habits in terms of the tree species utilized and sleeping nest heights. We recorded a total of 550 chimpanzee nests at Bagnomba between January 2015 and December 2015. The chimpanzees here made nests in particular tree species more often than others. The majority of nests (63%) were in two tree species: Diospyros mespiliformis and Pterocarpus erinaceus. The average height of nesting trees was 10.54 m (SD 3.91, range, 0.0-29.0 m) and average nest height was 7.90 m (SD 3.62, range, 0.0-25.0 m). The result of a linear regression analysis (r = 0.7874; n = 550; p < 0.05) is consistent with a preference for nesting at a particular height. Bagnomba chimpanzees rarely made ground nests (0.36% of nests), but the presence of any ground nesting was unexpected, given that at least one leopard (Panthera pardus) also occupied the hill. This knowledge will enable stakeholders involved in the protection of chimpanzees specifically and of biodiversity in general to better understand chimpanzee ecology and inform a conservation action plan in Senegal where the survival of this species is threatened.","[Badji, L.; Ndiaye, P.

On the basis of the key technical analysis of farmland-elevating engineering, this paper constructed a value system of farmland-elevating engineering from aspects of social value, ecological value, and economic value and established corresponding measurement models, respectively. Taking a key water conservancy project in Jiangxi province as an example, this paper measures the value of farmland-elevating engineering implemented in this project.

A private nonprofit seeking to develop an urban conservation program in the Atlanta metropolitan area purposefully engaged residents from surrounding communities and self-identified local and sector leaders to identify communities where social equity and conservation objectives could be created together. A public agency, built on a century-long history of environmental stewardship for migratory birds and pollinators, integrated 20 years of participatory action research to engage the surrounding communities using methods suggested and developed by the communities themselves. In both cases, community-based research approaches have helped establish cocreated objectives and flexible monitoring and evaluation baselines.

The availability and accessibility of multispectral and radar satellite remote sensing (SRS) imagery are at an unprecedented high. These data have both become standard source of information for investigating species ecology and ecosystems structure, composition and function at large scales. Since they capture complementary aspects of the Earth's surface, synergies between these two types of imagery have the potential to greatly expand research and monitoring opportunities. However, despite the benefits of combining multispectral and radar SRS data, data fusion techniques, including image fusion, are not commonly used in biodiversity monitoring, ecology and conservation. 2. To help close this application gap, we provide for the first time an overview of the most common SRS data fusion techniques, discussing their benefits and drawbacks, and pull together case studies illustrating the added value for biodiversity research and monitoring. 3.Integrating and fusing multispectral and radar images can significantly improve our ability to assess the distribution as well as the horizontal and vertical structure of ecosystems. Additionally, SRS data fusion has the potential to increase opportunities for mapping species distribution and community composition, as well as for monitoring threats to biodiversity. Uptake of these techniques will benefit from more effective collaboration between remote sensing and biodiversity experts, making the reporting of methodologies more transparent, expanding SRS image processing capacity and promoting widespread open access to satellite imagery. 4. In the context of a global biodiversity crisis, being able to track subtle changes in the biosphere across adequate spatial and temporal extents and resolutions is crucial. By making key parameter estimates derived from SRS data more accurate, SRS data fusion promises to become a powerful tool to help address current monitoring needs, and could support the development of essential biodiversity variables.","[Buhne, Henrike Schulte To; Pettorelli, Nathalie] Zool Soc London, Inst Zool, London, England",nathalie.pettorelli@ioz.ac.uk,127,24,24,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2041-210X,METHODS ECOL EVOL,Methods Ecol.

The study was conducted across central and southern China. We developed a habitat suitability model for the Critically Endangered Chinese giant salamander (Andrias davidianus) based on one biotic and three abiotic parameters from single-site locality records, which represent the only relevant environmental data available for this species. We then validated model quality by testing whether increased percentage of predicted suitable habitat at the county level correlated with independent data on giant salamander presence. We randomly selected 48 counties containing historical records which were distinct from, and independent of, the single-site records used to develop the model, and 47 additional counties containing >50% predicted suitable habitat. We interviewed 2,812 respondents near potential giant salamander habitat across these counties and tested for differences in respondent giant salamander reports between counties selected using each method. Our model predicts that suitable giant salamander habitat is found widely across central and southern China, with counties containing 50% predicted suitable habitat distributed in 13 provinces. Counties with historical records contain significantly more predicted suitable habitat than counties without historical records. There are no statistical differences in any patterns of respondent giant salamander reports in surveyed counties selected from our model compared with the areas of known historical giant salamander distribution. A Chinese giant salamander habitat suitability model with strong predictive power can be derived from the restricted range of environmental variables associated with limited available presence-only occurrence records, constituting a cost-effective strategy to guide spatial allocation of conservation planning. Few reported sightings were recent, however, with most being over 20 years old, so that identification of areas of suitable habitat does not necessarily indicate continued survival of the species at these locations.","[Chen, Shu; Cunningham, Andrew A.; Harrison, Xavier A.; Pettorelli, Nathalie; Turvey, Samuel T.] Zool Soc London, Inst Zool, London, England; [Wei, Gang] Guiyang Univ, Guiyang, Guizhou, Peoples R China; [Yang, Jian] Guangxi Teachers Educ Univ, Nanning, Peoples R China; [Liang, Zhiqiang] Fisheries Res Inst Hunan Prov, Changsha, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Wang, Jie] Chinese Acad Sci, Chengdu Inst Biol, Chengdu, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Wu, Minyao] Shaanxi Normal Univ, Xian, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Yan, Fang] Chinese Acad Sci, Kunming Inst Zool, Kunming, Yunnan, Peoples R China; [Xiao, Hanbin] Chinese Acad Fisheries Sci, Yangtze River Fisheries Res Inst, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China",a.cunningham@ioz.ac.uk; samuel.turvey@ioz.ac.uk,70,17,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

Species richness and soil nutrients play important roles in ecological uniqueness, but it is still unclear how different life forms, multiple biodiversity attributes, and environmental factors affect ecological uniqueness. In this study, we conducted a community investigation to combine species diversity, functional diversity, phylogenetic diversity, and soil factors to evaluate the impact of biotic and abiotic factors on ecological uniqueness. We verified these different relationships in woody and herbaceous plants. Our results showed that the species contribution to beta diversity (SCBD) of herbaceous plants was higher than that of other species, and SCBD had a strong correlation with species abundance and leaf thickness. Ecological uniqueness can be explained by soil factors and community characteristics, but the relative importance and interpretation of these characteristics differ between communities and between woody and herbaceous plants. Soil factors and community characteristics explained more of the ecological uniqueness in woody plants than herbaceous plants and communities. The community ecological uniqueness was mainly affected by soil pH. Soil moisture content and phylogenetic diversity had extremely significant positive effects on the ecological uniqueness of woody plants, while species richness and functional richness had significant negative effects. pH had a significant positive effect on the ecological uniqueness of herbaceous plants, and soil moisture indirectly affected the herb ecological uniqueness by affecting pH. In brief, the result showed that SCBD is significantly related to plant abundance, functional traits and leaf nutrients. In addition to focusing on sites with high species richness, functional diversity, and phylogenetic diversity, a comprehensive analysis from the perspective of different life forms can fully reflect the ecological uniqueness and proceed with species protection.","[Wang, Hengfang; Zhang, Rui; Cai, Yan; Yang, Qi; Lv, Guanghui] Xinjiang Univ, Minist Educ, Xinjiang Jinghe Observat & Res Stn Temperate Dese, Key Lab Oasis Ecol,Educ Minist,Coll Ecol & Enviro, Urumqi 830046, Peoples R China",db15020016b0yj@cumt.edu.cn,49,0,0,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",,GLOB ECOL CONSERV,Glob.

However, owing to human activities, the diversity of freshwater mussels is seriously globally threatened. China is an important global biodiversity hotspot for this fauna. This article comprehensively reviews the 99 currently recognized species in China, collating for the first time their systematics, distribution, life-history traits, habitat preferences, conservation status, and main threats to suggest future management actions. The review showed that the taxonomic status and species validity of many freshwater mussels are still not well resolved. The freshwater mussel diversity in the Yangtze River Basin is higher than that in other freshwater habitats in China. Life history characteristics and habitat preferences are poorly known for most species. Only half of the total number of species in China have been assessed for their conservation status. Among those assessed, around half of them are threatened with extinction with more than 10% being considered as Data Deficient. The key threats identified as potentially related to species declines are pollution, habitat loss and fragmentation, loss of access to host fishes and overharvesting of mussels or their host fishes. The review shows that there is a strong geographical bias in the amount of knowledge available for freshwater mussels, with most of the available data being concentrated in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze basin. Almost no data are available for these taxa north of the Yellow River basin and in the west and south-west regions of China. To make future conservation and management more effective we suggest that efforts should be concentrated on: (i) increasing the amount of research on basic ecological and life-history features, including growth, life-span, reproductive cycle, host fish identification and habitat requirements of each species; (ii) establishing the interspecific and intraspecific genetic diversity patterns of Chinese freshwater mussels, to clarify their taxonomy, systematics and phylogeny, and to understand the phylogeography and population structure of each species; and (iii) urgently establishing protected areas for fish and mussels in locations of high species richness, such as Poyang Lake and Dongting Lake, and also in regions with high levels of endemism or genetic uniqueness, such as Guangxi Province, Yunnan Province and Heilongjiang Province. In addition, the need for habitat restoration and the conservation of freshwater mussels has become urgent in China, and an integrated systematic conservation and management plan should be developed and effectively implemented.","[Liu, Xiongjun] Jiaying Univ, Sch Life Sci, Guangdong Prov Key Lab Conservat & Precis Utiliza, Meizhou, Peoples R China; [Liu, Xiongjun; Wu, Ruiwen; Ouyang, Shan; Wu, Xiaoping] Nanchang Univ, Sch Life Sci, Nanchang 330031, Jiangxi, Peoples R China; [Liu, Yueying] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Zool, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Wu, Ruiwen] Shanxi Normal Univ, Sch Life Sci, Linfen, Shanxi, Peoples R China; [Zanatta, David T.] Cent Michigan Univ, Biol Dept, Inst Great Lakes Res, Mt Pleast, MI USA; [Lopes-Lima, Manuel; Goncalves, Duarte, V] Univ Porto, CIBIO InBIO Res Ctr Biodivers & Genet Resources, Campus Agr Vairao, Vairao, Portugal; [Lopes-Lima, Manuel; Goncalves, Duarte, V] CIBIO, BIOPOLIS Program Genom Biodivers & Land Planning, Campus Vairao, Vairao, Portugal; [Lopes-Lima, Manuel; Goncalves, Duarte, V] Univ Porto, CIIMAR CIMAR Interdisciplinary Ctr Marine & Envir, Ave Gen, Norton De Matos, Matosinhos, Portugal; [Bogan, Arthur E.] North Carolina Museum Nat Sci, Raleigh, NC USA",xpwu@ncu.edu.cn,157,0,0,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1052-7613,AQUAT CONSERV,Aquat.

Using both an online survey and an in-person workshop, we engaged a diversity of fishing industry stakeholders including scientists, technology companies, trawl net makers, and fishermen working with North Pacific, United States, trawl fisheries to identify and prioritize areas in which further knowledge is required for successful implementation of conservation engineering practices. In addition, we identified barriers to addressing these knowledge-needs. Knowledge-needs related to fishing gear performance were identified among the top priorities, including several areas targeted at improving fishing efficiency that could further advance the sustainability of well-managed trawl fisheries. To better understand the composition and behavior of target versus non-target catch, workshop participants identified the importance of closing data and technology gaps. This highlights areas for potential collaboration between fishermen, researchers, and technology companies to address research prioritized by the end-user. Further, results from the workshop emphasized a need for industry-driven training and workshops focused on elevating fishermen skill for newer entrants through peer-learning and knowledge-sharing to achieve objectives like better non-target avoidance and increased fishing efficiency of the target species. Addressing these prioritized knowledge-needs, by first working toward overcoming the industry-identified barriers, may aid in increasing uptake of conservation practices, thereby contributing to the long-term sustainability of these fisheries and associated social-ecological systems.","[Murphy, Robert; Wolf, Nathan; Kroska, Anita C.; Harris, Bradley P.] Alaska Pacific Univ, Fisheries Aquat Sci & Technol Lab, Anchorage, AK 99508 USA; [Yochum, Noelle] NOAA, Midwater Assessment & Conservat Engn Program, Resource Assessment & Conservat Engn Div, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv,Alaska Fisheries Sci C, Seattle, WA USA",rdmurphy@alaskapacific.edu,40,0,0,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,FRONT MAR SCI,Front.

We propose an ecological accounting framework for aquatic ecosystems using habitat equivalents scaled to aquatic productivity, and using fish-to-habitat associations by life stage, based on local fish community needs. The framework uses both landscape-scale and site-level evaluations of pre- and post-project habitat changes to assign and track habitat parcels, using ecological baselines and fish-habitat target setting. Concepts of natural capital reserves and productivity-based ecotypes are used for trading losses and gains between impacts from development projects and offsets, including restoration actions, while maintaining ecologically important areas intact. Traditional accounting terms such as deposits, withdrawals, and transfers are defined using scaled habitat-equivalents as the currency. Other key features of the framework include setting a service area that is ecologically meaningful, and conducting habitat transactions guided by habitat conservation, protection, and restoration (habitat CPR) principles. The nearshore area of the Toronto and Region is used as a case study to illustrate the eco-accounting framework and how habitat banking could be incorporated along with planned restoration to remediate this degraded but continually developed area. The framework represents significant advances in managing cumulative habitat effects in an integrated way, moving away from a focus on only project- or site-level assessments. We feel this approach could be adapted to other ecosystem types in addition to the lake, nearshore area example provided here.","[Doka, Susan E.; Minns, Charles K.] Fisheries & Oceans Canada, Great Lakes Lab Fisheries & Aquat Sci, 867 Lakeshore Rd, Burlington, ON L7S 1A1, Canada; [Minns, Charles K.] Univ Toronto, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, 25 Willcocks St, Toronto, ON M5S 3B2, Canada; [Valere, Brent G.] Fisheries & Oceans Canada, Fish & Fish Habitat Protect Program, 867 Lakeshore Rd, Burlington, ON L7S 1A1, Canada; [Cooke, Steven J.] Carleton Univ, Dept Biol, Fish Ecol & Conservat Physiol Lab, 1125 Colonel By Dr, Ottawa, ON K1S 5B6, Canada; [Portiss, Rick J.; Sciscione, Thomas F.] Toronto & Reg Conservat Author, 5 Shoreham Dr, Downsview, ON M3N 1S4, Canada; [Rose, Alwyn] Fisheries & Oceans Canada, Ecosyst Management Policies & Practices, 200 Kent St, Ottawa, ON K1A 0E6, Canada; [Rose, Alwyn] Canadian Wildlife Serv, Environm & Climate Change Canada, Pl Vincent Massey,351,Boul St Joseph 14th Floor, Gatineau, PQ K1A 0H3, Canada",susan.doka@dfo-mpo.gc.ca,88,0,0,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0364-152X,ENVIRON MANAGE,Environ.

To support the species' conservation, we assessed its potential distribution, conservation priority areas, core patch fragmentation, and potential connectivity corridors in Northeast China. We concluded that large areas of a high-quality M. moschiferus habitat with low fragmentation and low human influence remain in the northern Greater Khingan Mountains. In contrast, a habitat in the Lesser Khingan Mountains and the Changbai Mountains was highly fragmented and highly influenced by human activity. The Greater Khingan Mountains offer a suitable habitat for the recovery of M. moschiferus populations in Northeast China. These findings offer recommendations to support the Chinese government's goal of establishing protected area systems with national parks in Northeast China. Species conservation actions are guided by available information on the biogeography of the protected species. In this study, we integrated the occurrence data of Siberian musk deer (Moschus moschiferus L.) collected from 2019 to 2021 with species distribution models to estimate the species' potential distribution in Northeast China. We then identified conservation priority areas using a core-area zonation algorithm. In addition, we analyzed core patch fragmentation using FRAGSTATS. Lastly, we identified potential connectivity corridors and constructed a potential protection network based on the least-cost path and the circuit theory. The results showed concentrations of M. moschiferus in the northern Greater Khingan Mountains, the southeastern Lesser Khingan Mountains, and the eastern Changbai Mountains, with a potential distribution area of 127,442.14 km(2). Conservation priority areas included 41 core patches with an area of 106,306.43 km(2). Patch fragmentation mainly occurred in the Changbai Mountains and the Lesser Khingan Mountains. We constructed an ecological network composed of 41 core patches and 69 linkages for M. moschiferus in Northeast China. The results suggest that the Greater Khingan Mountains represent the most suitable area to maintain the stability of M. moschiferus populations in Northeast China. Considering the high habitat quality requirements of M. moschiferus and its endangered status, we propose that the Chinese government accelerates the construction of the Greater Khingan Mountains National Park and the Lesser Khingan Mountains National Park and enlarges the Northeast China Tiger and Leopard National Park to address the fragmentation of protected areas and the habitat of M. moschiferus.","[Zhang, Chao; Fan, Yuwei; Chen, Minhao; Wang, Jiadong; Zhan, Zhenjie; Wang, Wenlong; Khan, Tauheed Ullah; Wu, Shuhong; Luan, Xiaofeng] Beijing Forestry Univ, Sch Ecol & Nat Conservat, 35 Tsinghua East Rd, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China; [Xia, Wancai] China West Normal Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab Southwest China Wildlife Resources Conser, Nanchong 637009, Peoples R China",zc21192@163.com; fanyuwei2021@163.com; Demominhao@gmail.com; xiawancai2013@163.com; wangjiadong_2019@163.com; a472705335@163.com; wangwenlong1016@163.com; eco.tauheed@hotmail.com; wshuhong@126.com; luanxiaofeng@bjfu.edu.cn,62,0,0,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",2076-2615,ANIMALS-BASEL,Animals,2022,"gold, Green Published",

The reference genome allows us to develop a suite of tools to understand both genome-wide and functional diversity within and between species. Conservation practitioners can use these tools to inform their decision-making. But, at present there is an implementation gap between the release of genome information and the use of genomic data in applied conservation by conservation practitioners.

While it is crucial to constantly monitor and assess ecological impacts, baseline data are scanty for ecologically sensitive regions and biodiversity hotspots such as the Western Ghats. With their great public appeal and ease to work with, butterflies are excellent communities to monitor the ecological health. To characterize the baseline patterns of butterfly communities, using time-constrained counts, we surveyed eight heterogeneous landscapes of the coastal plains of the Western Ghats. We recorded 43,118 individuals and 175 species, with large differences in their diversity and species-specific abundances among habitats. The coastal and semi-evergreen-forest habitats were at the two extremes with intermediate patterns in agricultural and other habitats that suffered diverse anthropogenic pressures. Using indicator value analysis, 22 habitat-specific and several shared indicator species were identified. Even some of the most abundant species showed distinct niches, and therefore can be used as indicator species to monitor community dynamics. Patterns of numerous habitat-specific host-plant butterfly species pairs that were identified were discussed in relation to butterfly abundance and conservation.

The comprehensive management of small, headwater watersheds is a particularly important means to control soil erosion. In this study, a distributed hydrological model was created for a typical small headwater watershed in the rocky karst desertification region of Guizhou Province to determine the impacts of soil and water conservation measures on basin hydrology. The results showed that: (1) recently conducted soil and water conservation measures led to an increase in total evaporation by 1.55% from 2015 (prior to watershed treatments) to 2017 (following watershed treatments). Changes in evaporation were accompanied by a decrease in basin runoff, an increase in water storage, and an improvement in available water in the small karst basin by 17.84% following the implementation of the measures; and (2) after the implementation of recent soil and water conservation measures, the evaporation capacity of the watershed during a wet year increased by 1.00%, the runoff decreased by 10.00%, and the total amount of soil water storage increased by 5% compared with those before implementation. During an average year, the evaporation and water storage in the watershed increased by 1.28% and 5.73%, respectively, whereas the runoff decreased by 7.10%. Soil water consumption and water storage of the watershed increased, significantly reducing flow. The scientifically based assessment conducted herein provides significant insights for correctly guiding ecological construction in karst watersheds.

This paper reviews the ecological relationship between humans and Asian elephants (Elephas maximus) in the rainforests of the Malay Peninsula, examining the extent of differentiation of spatio-temporal and trophic niches. We highlight the strategies that people and elephants use to partition an overlapping fundamental niche. When elephants are present, forest-dwelling people often build above-the-ground shelters; and when people are present, elephants avoid open areas during the day. People are able to access several foods that are out of reach of elephants or inedible; for example, people use water to leach poisons from tubers of wild yams, use blowpipes to kill arboreal game, and climb trees to access honey. We discuss how the transition to agriculture affected the human-elephant relationship by increasing the potential for competition.

So is the Danube Clouded Yellow butterfly, Colias myrmidone, with few populations left in three Eastern European countries, namely Poland, Slovakia and Romania. However, ecological understanding of its relationship to environmental conditions and land-use practises is piecemeal. Here, we quantify the environmental conditions determining the distribution of C. myrmidone for some of its last known strongholds in Romania. We performed random stratified searches for the butterfly and its hostplant Chamaecytisus sp. in and around three Natura 2000 sites in Transylvania, which we have subdivided into 100 x 100 m grid cells. During 2016-2019, we observed C. myrmidone in 1765 grid cells. Logistic regression modelling related the presence of C. myrmidone and its hostplant to temperature, precipitation, slope, distance to forest, land cover and aspect. The butterfly was more likely to occur with higher temperatures and higher precipitation and was associated with flat and slightly inclined slopes near forests. Furthermore, the probability was higher on grasslands, pastures and in agricultural mosaic landscapes compared to arable land and forests, with a preference for an Eastern and north-western aspect. We extrapolated these findings to predict potential other areas of occurrences with a precision of 91%.

In addition, a statistical test of the colonization distances in the latitudinal and longitudinal directions was performed. We also conducted ecological niche modeling for two widely distributed species using climatic data. Ancestral geographic reconstruction estimated the origin of the genus to be around the Indian subcontinental region and showed that latitudinal immigration distances were shorter than longitudinal immigration distances in the diversification process. Ecological niche models suggested that the current distribution was restricted by climate, with annual mean temperature and precipitation of the driest month as particularly strong factors. Niche conservatism to the climate can affect the diversification of freshwater snails.","[Saito, Takumi; Ye, Bin] Tohoku Univ, Grad Sch Life Sci, Sendai, Miyagi, Japan; Toho Univ, Dept Biol, Fac Sci, Funabashi, Chiba, Japan; [Hirano, Takahiro; Chiba, Satoshi] Tohoku Univ, Ctr Northeast Asian Studies, Sendai, Miyagi, Japan; [Prozorova, Larisa] Russian Acad Sci, Far Eastern Branch, Fed Sci Ctr, East Asia Terr Biodivers, Vladivostok, Russia; [Shovon, Mohammad Shariar] Rajshahi Univ, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, Rajshahi, Bangladesh; [Do, Tu Van] Vietnam Acad Sci & Technol, Inst Ecol & Biol Resources, Hanoi, Vietnam; [Do, Tu Van] Vietnam Acad Sci & Technol, Grad Univ Sci & Technol, Hanoi, Vietnam; [Kimura, Kazuki] Kyungpook Natl Univ, Res Inst Ulleung & Dok Isl, Dept Biol, Daegu, South Korea; [Surenkhorloo, Purevdorj] Mongolian Benthol Soc MOBS, Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia; [Kameda, Yuichi] Natl Museum Nat & Sci, Mol Biodivers Res, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan; [Morii, Yuta] Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Sci, Dept Zool, Lab Anim Ecol, Kyoto, Japan; [Morii, Yuta] Kyoto Univ, Hakubi Ctr, Kyoto, Japan; [Fukuda, Hiroshi] Okayama Univ, Conservat Aquat Biodivers, Fac Agr, Okayama, Japan",saito.zef@gmail.com,102,0,0,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

The endemic Cuban Black-Hawk (Buteogallus gundlachii) is threatened by habitat loss as similar to 50% of its original habitat has been fragmented by tourism activity. Despite this situation, little information on its population size is available and its abundance patterns in relation to environmental variables are largely unknown. Such information is urgently needed to understand its geographic distribution and population abundance trends. We modeled the spatial patterns of abundance of the hawk in central Cuba and then assessed the effectiveness of protected areas for conserving this species. We fitted an ecological niche model to occurrence data of the Cuban Black-Hawk. The centroid of the predicted distribution range was calculated in ecological space and the multidimensional Euclidean distance to the niche centroid (DNC) was estimated. A function describing the relationship between the species abundance and the distance to the niche centroid was used to construct a map depicting the distribution of the Cuban Black-Hawk abundance. The potential distribution range of the raptor encompasses a 703.4 km(2) area and represents 12.5% of the total study area. Results show an inverse relationship between DNC and abundance (R-2 = 0.37): the sites closer to the centroid of the ecological niche of the species contain more individuals. The model shows that a shorter distance to the coastline and larger distance to urban zones increase the probability of occurrence of the hawk. Based on these results, we estimated that only 24% of the area where a high hawk abundance is expected is currently included in protected areas. We suggest establishing priority survey sites and strengthening protection of the Cuban Black-Hawk in the zones we identified as most valuable in the archipelago. This approach could also be used for other rare and endemic species in other ecosystems.","[Ferrer-Sanchez, Yarelys] Univ Tecn Estatal Quevedo, Los Rios, Ecuador; [Rodriguez-Estrella, Ricardo] Inst Politecn Nacl, Ctr Invest Biol Noroeste, 195 Playa Palo Santa Rita Sur, La Paz 23096, Baja California, Mexico",estrella@cibnor.mx,88,0,0,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",,GLOB ECOL CONSERV,Glob.

However, several of the species are considered at risk of extinction. One of the strategies for their conservation is the maintenance of legally protected areas in which administration is prescribed by a management plan. Species inventories form the basis of this instrument as it allows to identify key resources and taxons. We reviewed the management plans of Brazilian protected areas to assess the suitability of methods employed to identify deer species. We reviewed 118 management plans (covering 298,000 km(2) of protected area) and checked each occurrence record for information regarding detection methods, which we classified according to their suitability for species-level identification. We found that 38% of the records did not report the species detection method used. Specific identifications were obtained through seven different methodologies, of which 12% were considered suitable, 28% were suitable with caveats, and 60% were unsuitable for species identification. We conclude it is necessary to improve the scientific rigor applied to inventories and data collection to avoid producing further inconsistent information, as this might affect management actions and risks the exclusion of threatened species from public policies on conservation planning.

This narrative review summarizes and analyses the ecological effects of the land-based activities walking, biking, nature observing and relaxing on the shoreline as well as the water-based activities swimming, snorkelling, scuba diving, and canyoning. Searching multiple databases with standardized search terms retrieved twenty-six publications for further analyses. While walking was the most studied activity, birds were the most studied organism group, with a focus on individual time budgets and avoidance behaviour. Population-level analyses were exceedingly rare. The most frequently studied activityeffect combinations were walking and birds, walking and terrestrial plants and scuba diving/snorkelling and fishes. Aquatic plants, amphibians, reptiles, water chemical parameters and terrestrial and aquatic algae were underrepresented in the existing literature. No study on mammals was identified. Disturbance often led to temporary behavioural changes of birds and wildlife. Plants were more strongly impacted than animals, suffering from recreation-induced damage and dieback, which led to changes in community composition. The difference in intensity of impact between mobile and sessile organisms calls for different management strategies, depending on local conservation targets. Future studies should focus on underrepresented taxonomic groups and study population or community-level impacts, to collectively provide the sound scientific basis for the sustainable recreational use of inland water bodies, while minimizing or avoiding severe ecological impacts.","[Meyer, Nora; von Oheimb, Goddert] Tech Univ Dresden, Inst Gen Ecol & Environm Protect, Pienner Str 7, D-01737 Tharandt, Germany; [Schafft, Malwina; Wegner, Benjamin; Wolter, Christian; Arlinghaus, Robert] Leibniz Inst Freshwater Ecol & Inland Fisheries, Dept Biol & Ecol Fishes, Muggelseedamm 310, D-12587 Berlin, Germany; [Venohr, Markus] Leibniz Inst Freshwater Ecol & Inland Fisheries, Dept Ecohydrol, Muggelseedamm 310, D-12587 Berlin, Germany; [Schafft, Malwina; Wegner, Benjamin; Arlinghaus, Robert] Humboldt Univ, Fac Life Sci, Dept Crop & Anim Sci, Div Integrat Fisheries Management, Philippstr 13,Haus 7, D-10115 Berlin, Germany",nora.meyer@tu-dresden.de,104,0,0,ELSEVIER GMBH,MUNICH,"HACKERBRUCKE 6, 80335 MUNICH, GERMANY",1617-1381,J NAT CONSERV,J.

Many extant lemuriform folivores exist in sympatry in Madagascar's remaining forests. These species avoid feeding competition by adopting different dietary strategies within folivory, reflected in behavioral, morphological, and microbiota diversity across species. These conditions make lemurs an ideal study system for understanding adaptation to leaf-eating. Most folivorous lemurs are also highly endangered. The significance of folivory for conservation outlook is complex. Though generalist folivores may be relatively well equipped to survive habitat disturbance, specialist folivores occupying narrow dietary niches may be less resilient. Characterizing the genetic bases of adaptation to folivory across species and lineages can provide insights into their differential physiology and potential to resist habitat change. We recently reported accelerated genetic change in RNASE1, a gene encoding an enzyme (RNase 1) involved in molecular adaptation in mammalian folivores, including various monkeys and sifakas (genus Propithecus; family Indriidae). Here, we sought to assess whether other lemurs, including phylogenetically and ecologically diverse folivores, might show parallel adaptive change in RNASE1 that could underlie a capacity for efficient folivory. We characterized RNASE1 in 21 lemur species representing all five families and members of the three extant folivorous lineages: (1) bamboo lemurs (family Lemuridae), (2) sportive lemurs (family Lepilemuridae), and (3) indriids (family Indriidae). We found pervasive sequence change in RNASE1 across all indriids, a d(N)/d(S) value > 3 in this clade, and evidence for shared change in isoelectric point, indicating altered enzymatic function. Sportive and bamboo lemurs, in contrast, showed more modest sequence change. The greater change in indriids may reflect a shared strategy emphasizing complex gut morphology and microbiota to facilitate folivory. This case study illustrates how genetic analysis may reveal differences in functional traits that could influence species' ecology and, in turn, their resilience to habitat change. Moreover, our results support the body of work demonstrating that not all primate folivores are built the same and reiterate the need to avoid generalizations about dietary guild in considering conservation outlook, particularly in lemurs where such diversity in folivory has probably led to extensive specialization via niche partitioning.","[Guevara, Elaine E.] Univ North Carolina Wilmington, Dept Anthropol, Wilmington, NC 28403 USA; [Guevara, Elaine E.; Bradley, Brenda J.] George Washington Univ, Ctr Adv Study Human Paleobiol, Washington, DC 20037 USA; [Greene, Lydia K.; Blanco, Marina B.; Williams, Cathy, V] Duke Univ, Duke Lemur Ctr, Durham, NC USA; [Greene, Lydia K.; Blanco, Marina B.; Yoder, Anne D.] Duke Univ, Dept Biol, Durham, NC USA; [Greene, Lydia K.; Clayton, Jonathan B.] Univ Nebraska, Primate Microbiome Project, Lincoln, NE USA; [Farmer, Casey] Northern Illinois Univ, Dept Anthropol, De Kalb, IL 60115 USA; [Ranaivonasy, Jeannin; Ratsirarson, Joelisoa] Univ Antananarivo, Sch Agron, Dept Agroecol Biodivers & Cilmate Change, Antananarivo, Madagascar; [Mahefarisoa, Karine L.; Rajaonarivelo, Tsiky; Rakotondrainibe, Hajanirina H.; Junge, Randall E.; Williams, Cathy, V] Ambatovy Minerals SA, Antananarivo, Madagascar; [Mahefarisoa, Karine L.] Sadabe NGO, Antananarivo, Madagascar; [Rajaonarivelo, Tsiky] Cabinet Happy Paws Vet, Mandrosoa Ivato, Madagascar; [Junge, Randall E.] Columbus Zoo & Aquarium, Columbus, OH USA; [Rambeloson, Elodi; Rasoanaivo, Hoby A.] Anjajavy le Lodge & Reserve, Antananarivo, Sofia Region, Madagascar; [Rahalinarivo, Vololonirina] Univ Antananarivo, Dept Anthropobiol & Sustainable Dev, Antananarivo, Madagascar; [Andrianandrianina, Laza H.] Ctr ValBio, Ranomafana, Madagascar; [Clayton, Jonathan B.] Univ Nebraska, Dept Biol, Omaha, NE 68182 USA; [Clayton, Jonathan B.] Univ Nebraska, Dept Food Sci & Technol, Lincoln, NE 68583 USA; [Clayton, Jonathan B.] Univ Nebraska, Nebraska Food Hlth Ctr, Lincoln, NE USA; [Rothman, Ryan S.] SUNY Stony Brook, Interdept Doctoral Program Anthropol Sci, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA; [Rothman, Ryan S.] SUNY Stony Brook, Inst Conservat Trop Environm, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA; [Lawler, Richard R.] James Madison Univ, Dept Sociol & Anthropol, Harrisonburg, VA 22807 USA",gomezguevarae@uncw.edu,124,0,0,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",2296-701X,FRONT ECOL EVOL,Front.

We present a systematic literature review focusing on small-scale private forest owners and their perspectives on nature conservation by synthesizing research approaches, social-ecological drivers, and policy recommendations. Conservation perspectives were positively related to female gender, higher levels of education, formalized forest management, an active relation to the forest, and ecological values of the property. In contrast, high age, rural orientation, economic forest management factors, large parcel size, and economic and sentimental property values negatively influenced conservation perspectives. Applying a natural resource conflict management framework, we synthesized recommendations covering three dimensions: substance, procedure, relationship.

However, a challenge for the conservation and management of listed ecosystems is consistent identification in the field or from plot records. Ecosystem descriptions must have enough detail for positive identification but be broad enough that most instances are included. In many jurisdictions, descriptions are not supported by dichotomous keys or thresholds of ecosystem collapse and identification relies on the interpretation of trained individuals, with potential for opposing opinions. Using a structured process, we assessed the ability of experts to identify a critically endangered ecological community from vegetation plot samples. We compared the allocations made by experts with a numeric classification that underpinned the legal definition of the community. Overall, experts correctly identified the presence or absence of the community in 81% of samples although individual classification rates ranged from 63% to 94%. False positive rates varied among experts (7-50%) and experienced botanists did not necessarily perform better. Disturbance increased uncertainty and experts differed in their opinion about when the community had collapsed and was no longer recoverable. Inconsistent interpretation, in the absence of diagnostic keys and consensus models of collapse, will have implications for recovery and conservation of listed communities and ecosystems, and could impact the effectiveness of laws and policies designed to protect them.","[Dorrough, Josh; Tozer, Mark; Summerell, Gregory] Dept Planning Ind & Environm, Sci Econ & Insights Div, Merimbula, NSW, Australia; [Armstrong, Rob] Biodivers Conservat Trust, Newcastle, NSW, Australia; [Scott, Mitchell L.] Dept Planning Ind & Environm, Biodivers & Conservat Div, Merimbula, NSW, Australia",josh.dorrough@environment.nsw.gov.au,75,1,1,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",,CONSERV SCI PRACT,Conserv.

Exploration of ecological niche models and niche-divergence among closely-related and cryptic organisms can also be useful for species delineation and discrimination, and such information can inform and facilitate conservation of their populations. In this study, I used an ecological niche modeling approach to investigate the conservation biogeography of the fork-marked lemurs (genus Phaner), a group of cryptic, nocturnal primates that are endemic to Madagascar. I constructed all ecological niche models in MaxEnt, using a range of climatic and habitat-related variables. I examined interspecific niche-separation within the Phaner genus, and among two sub-populations of P. electromontis, a species which has previously been hypothesized to represent two distinct, cryptic taxa. All ecological niche models performed well and with high accuracy, and whilst the percentage contribution of each environmental variable differed between species, the results suggested that climate may be the primary determinant of Phaner distribution. Further, all four Phaner species occupied distinct ecological niches, a result that was also mirrored in the two P. electromontis subpopulations. This suggests that one of the two sub-populations may indeed be a distinct, as-yet undescribed species, but further genetic and ecological research is needed to substantiate this result. Finally, the ecological niche models revealed that only 23.0% of the suitable land area for Phaner occurrence within Madagascar is forested, limiting the geographic distribution of these lemurs. Whilst much of this suitable habitat is thankfully protected, deforestation continues throughout Madagascar, and this under-studied group of lemurs requires further research attention and continued conservation efforts.","[Hending, Daniel] Univ Bristol, Sch Biol Sci, Bristol BS8 1TH, Avon, England; [Hending, Daniel] Bristol Zool Soc, Bristol BS8 3HA, Avon, England",danhending2@gmail.com,102,1,1,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2351-9894,GLOB ECOL CONSERV,Glob.

The identification of conservation priorities is of great significance for the maintenance and protection of key ESs. In this study, we quantified the spatiotemporal changes of net primary productivity (NPP), soil conservation (SC), water yield (WY) and habitat quality (HQ) in the major basins of Central Asia from 1995 to 2015. In addition, a GIS-based ordered weighted averaging (OWA) multi-criterion valuation method was adopted to identify potential conservation areas under 11 scenarios. Conservation priorities were determined by comparing the conservation efficiency under each scenario. Then, a broad range of indicators were considered to distinguish the driving factors affecting ESs in conservation priorities. The results show that the average conservation efficiency in the Issyk-Kul Basin was the highest, followed by the Am Darya Basin, Ili-Balkhash Basin and Syr Darya Basin. We observed that the conservation efficiency of the four ESs declined continuously in the Ili-Balkhash Basin from 1995 to 2015, while it changed steadily in the other three basins. Correlation analysis indicated that natural factors (e.g., precipitation and topography) were the main driving factors of WY, SR and NPP in conservation priorities, while HQ was more affected by socioeconomic factors (e.g., population density and both cropland and urban percentages). The identification of conservation priorities and their driving factors plays an important role in ensuring the ecological security of the lower reaches, regulating the regional water balance and stabilizing the climate pattern.","[Li, Jiangyue; Chen, Xi; Kurban, Alishir; Zhang, Chi] Chinese Acad Sci, Xinjiang Inst Ecol & Geog, State Key Lab Desert & Oasis Ecol, Urumqi 830011, Peoples R China; [Li, Jiangyue] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Li, Jiangyue; Van de Voorde, Tim; De Maeyer, Philippe] Univ Ghent, Dept Geog, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Li, Jiangyue; Chen, Xi; Kurban, Alishir; Van de Voorde, Tim; De Maeyer, Philippe] SinoBelgian Joint Lab Geoinformat, Urumqi 830011, Peoples R China; [Li, Jiangyue; Kurban, Alishir; Van de Voorde, Tim; De Maeyer, Philippe] SinoBelgian Joint Lab Geoinformat, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Chen, Xi; Zhang, Chi] Chinese Acad Sci, Res Ctr Ecol & Environm Cent Asia, Urumqi 830011, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Chi] Linyi Univ, Coll Resources & Environm, Shandong Prov Key Lab Water & Soil Conservat & En, Linyi 276000, Shandong, Peoples R China",zc@ms.xjb.ac.cn,91,0,0,ACADEMIC PRESS LTD- ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,LONDON,"24-28 OVAL RD, LONDON NW1 7DX, ENGLAND",0301-4797,J ENVIRON MANAGE,J.

However, there is limited understanding of how the diverse social-ecological contexts of PLCAs influence their effectiveness in conserving biodiversity. Here, we investigated how the effectiveness of South African PLCAs in conserving biodiversity varied across social-ecological contexts, using natural land cover as a proxy. Social-ecological contexts were represented by biophysical and legal factors (distance to towns and roads, elevation, slope, terrain ruggedness, rainfall, PLCA size, distance to state-owned national parks, and presence of legal protection) and, for a subset of commercially-operated PLCAs, management factors (adopted business model, and profitability). Biophysical and legal contextual factors had low explanatory power in the best model for the nationwide analysis (n = 5121 PLCAs). For a subset of PLCAs (n = 72) we found that effectiveness depended on the strategy they adopted to generate an income, as opposed to the amount of income itself. PLCAs that attracted high volumes of visitors to small properties to view charismatic Big 5 wildlife were less effective in conserving natural land cover than larger, more exclusive Big 5 PLCAs and those focused on hunting. Overall, site-specific management factors were better at explaining the effectiveness of PLCAs than biophysical factors. Our findings indicate that conservation practitioners and policy makers need to recognise the diverse goals, motivations and management models of PLCAs when considering how to support them in conserving biodiversity.

Establishing protected areas (PA) is one of the most viable solutions to averting this crisis. Although PA establishment in the past followed an ad-hoc approach without considering the conservation value of the prioritized areas, the development of systematic conservation planning approaches has largely maximized the conservation output by offering low-cost and high-efficiency spatial solutions. However, the conservation initiatives are still biased towards mammals and birds and despite the essential ecological role of plants, they are hardly taken as a proxy for conservation decision-making. Furthermore, although phylogenetic diversity captures areas that offer greater ecosystem functions, it remains largely neglected in conservation practice. In this study, using a comprehensive distribution dataset of 316 endemic seed plants in the central Himalaya and the time-calibrated phylogeny, we identified key areas for the systematic protection of species and evolutionary diversity of endemic seed plants. We found a large gap in protecting endemic seed plants in the central Himalaya likely due to disproportionate location of PAs. We recommend expanding protected areas to the mid-hills and lowlands to ensure better representation of biodiversity in the central Himalayan PA network. While flagship species undeniably require high conservation focus, our findings suggest the need to reassess the conservation priorities of less charismatic species too, as many of these species are crucial to ecosystem health and are at greater risk of extinction.","[Shrestha, Nawal] Lanzhou Univ, Inst Innovat Ecol, State Key Lab Grassland Agroecosyst, Lanzhou 730000, Peoples R China; [Shrestha, Nawal; Paudel, Prakash Kumar] Soc Conservat Biol Nepal, Bagdol, Lalitpur, Nepal; [Tiwari, Achyut] Tribuvan Univ, Cent Dept Bot, Kathmandu, Nepal; [Paudel, Prakash Kumar] Kathmandu Inst Appl Sci, Ctr Conservat Biol, Bagdol, Lalitpur, Nepal",nawalshrestha@gmail.com,66,0,0,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0006-3207,BIOL CONSERV,Biol.

While this is often true, in some social-ecological systems, unpredictable ecosystem dynamics and limited exploitation technology make it unlikely that people will overstep the ecological threshold, precluding the need for management rules. Here, two kinds of systems can emerge: open access systems in which individuals can meet their needs without cooperating with others, and a cooperative open access system in which social rules are required though management rules are not, because individuals need to cooperate to survive and to prevent erosion of cooperation by free-riders. We provide three brief case studies illustrating cooperative open access: Pantaneiro fishers, Agta hunter-gatherers, and Maasai pastoralists.

Furthermore, we have suggested future conservation strategies for the IRD based on the lesson learned from the conservation of the Yangtze finless porpoise (YFP; Neophocaena asiaeorientalis), a Critically Endangered freshwater cetacean. The major challenges for IRDs are habitat degradation, habitat fragmentation, and several types of industrial and agricultural pollutants. Worsening climatic changes, illegal fishing, and overfishing are additional threats. The construction of several barrages has fragmented the population into several short segments, some of which are too small for the IRDs to survive. In some segments, the population status of the IRD is unknown. In the remaining populations, genetic inbreeding, water shortage, canal entrapment, and altered ecological environment are potent negative factors for the survival of the IRD. Conservation strategies including fishing bans, translocation, and future research (tagging, periodic health assessments, necropsy and virtopsy, understanding the reproductive biology, and genomics) are possible recommendations.

Despite marine megafauna creating an important source of revenue though tourism, basic spatial information required to create conservation strategies is not available for many of these species. A cost-effective approach to assess the distribution of rare, non-commercial species is required to manage resources and inform conservation strategies in data-deficient areas. This study provides new information on the distribution and abundance of the zebra shark in southern Africa and examines if local ecological knowledge can be used to identify spatial and temporal trends of rare, non-commercial elasmobranchs. Trends identified from fisher interviews at two locations were compared to those collected using structured dive surveys. Both fisher interviews and structured surveys identified similar hotspot areas and temporal changes in the zebra shark population. Photographs of zebra sharks taken by researchers, dive operators, and recreational scuba divers between Pomene and Sodwana Bay were used to identify and provide information on the size, sex and movement of individuals. A combination of geo-located data gathered from one hundred interviews conducted with fishers at four different locations within Mozambique and sightings information from scuba divers were used in a species distribution model to determine the relative importance of environmental predictors and identify further areas of suitable habitat. Sea surface temperature was the most important factor in the coldest months, with distance from shore most limiting habitat suitability at other times of year. This approach could be applied in data-deficient regions to highlight areas of interest, prioritise research activities and inform conservation actions for rare, noncommercial marine megafauna.","[Pottie, Saoirse; Bull, James C.] Swansea Univ, Dept Biosci, Spatial & Populat Ecol Grp, Swansea SA2 8PP, W Glam, Wales; [Pottie, Saoirse] Royal Holloway Univ London, Dept Biosci, Egham TW20 0EY, Surrey, England; [Flam, Anna L.] Marine Megafauna Fdn, Truckee, CA, Mozambique; [Keeping, Jennifer A.] All Out Africa Marine Res Ctr, Praia Do Tofo, Mozambique; [Chivindze, Cacilda] Eduardo Mondlane Univ, Higher Sch Marine & Coastal Sci, 3453 Ave Julius Nyerere, Maputo, Mozambique; [Flam, Anna L.] Marine Megafauna Res Ctr, Praia Do Tofo, Inhambane, Mozambique",Saoirse.pottie.2020@live.rhul.ac.uk; anna@marinemegafauna.org; jennifer@alloutafrica.com; cacilda.chivindze@gmail.com; j.c.bull@swansea.ac.uk,104,1,1,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0964-5691,OCEAN COAST MANAGE,Ocean Coastal Manage.,2021,,

In this study, which was performed in the Madrid region (central Spain), we analyse the social-ecological changes of the rural landscape after the establishment of a protected natural area network. The obtained results highlight a significant loss of these high nature value farming systems and a marked increase in the rewilding processes characterised by scrub-forest transition and the development of forest systems. These processes are linked to the disruption of the transmission of traditional ecological knowledge, which may imply negative consequences for both the high biocultural diversity that these systems host and the cultural identity and the socioeconomics of the rural populations that live there.

However, the fragmented nature of private land tenure, the large number of landowners and their heterogeneous profiles can pose significant challenges for conservation initiatives. This can lead to a range in landowners' attitudes toward conservation initiatives, with some initiatives being received with resistance, and others with consent and participation. Most research dealing with social outcomes of conservation or restoration initiatives on private lands addresses regionally specific case studies, but few studies have attempted to derive general trends. To fill this gap, we performed a systematic literature review of conservation measures on private lands to develop a comprehensive typology of factors influencing the acceptance of conservation initiatives on private lands. Our results show that conservation agents (typically government agencies or NGOs), despite their limited power over individual factors of private landowners, can seek to encourage both the adoption and perceptions of conservation initiatives on private land through improving institutional interactions. We propose six recommendations to help support and design conservation programs on private lands and to identify intervention levers that may be acted upon to improve the social acceptance of such conservation initiatives.","[Tanguay, Louis; Bissonnette, Jean-Francois] Univ Laval, Fac Foresterie Geog & Geomat, Pavillon Abitibi Price,2405 Rue Terrasse, Laval, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada; [Tanguay, Louis] Univ Quebec Montreal, Fac Sci, 2098 Rue Kimberley, Montreal, PQ H3C 3P8, Canada; [Turgeon, Katrine] Univ Quebec Outaouais UQO, 58 Rue Principale, Ripon, PQ J0V 1V0, Canada; [Calme, Sophie] Univ Sherbrooke, Fac Sci, 2500 Blvd Univ, Sherbrooke, PQ J1K 2R1, Canada",louistanguay@gmail.com,116,0,0,IOP Publishing Ltd,BRISTOL,"TEMPLE CIRCUS, TEMPLE WAY, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1748-9326,ENVIRON RES LETT,Environ.

Elephant damage is the price local people pay for coexisting with this species, and is assumed to reduce tolerance for elephants. However, conservation-related projects, through the benefits they offer may enhance local tolerance toward elephants. This study aimed to examine how crop damage by elephants and the benefits gained from conservation activities affect local people's tolerance toward elephants around Moukalaba-Doudou National Park in southwest Gabon based on long-term ethnographic research and interview surveys in two periods (2010 and 2019). Based on the results, crop damage by elephants had a significant negative impact on the local social economy, leading to a decrease in human population in the area and making local people highly resentful of elephants. However, in one of the villages where employment from research and conservation activities was concentrated, many acknowledged the benefits associated with wildlife and expressed high tolerance for elephants. These findings suggest that benefits from conservation activities can increase tolerance toward elephants, which is negatively affected by the crop damage they cause. However, it should also be noted that externally generated projects have limitations and drawbacks. It is important to establish a system in which the benefits of conservation are shared widely and distributed appropriately, and wherein income resources are diversified. Multisectoral interventions focusing on local socio-ecological vulnerability are needed to mitigate human-elephant conflict and advance the conservation of African elephants.","[Terada, Saeko] Univ Tokyo, Sch Agr & Life Sci, Tokyo, Japan; [Yobo, Christian Mikolo] Ctr Natl Rech Sci & Technol, Inst Rech Ecol Trop, Libreville, Gabon; [Moussavou, Guy-Max] Ctr Natl Rech Sci & Technol, Inst Rech Sci Humaines, Libreville, Gabon; [Matsuura, Naoki] Univ Shizuoka, Sch Int Relat, Shizuoka, Japan",n-matsuura@u-shizuoka-ken.ac.jp,66,3,3,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1940-0829,TROP CONSERV SCI,Trop.

Urban green spaces are widely acknowledged to improve people's quality of life. Unlike in wild areas, plants in urban ecosystems develop in spaces strongly managed by human activity and tend to form different compositions than the natural landscape. Under this scenario, would the motivations and preferences of urbanresidents make it possible to conserve a sample of the local diversity in these spaces? To answer this question, we apply a semistructured survey to 100 homes that have a residential sidewalk garden in Santiago de Chile. Our results show that these gardens are perceived as an essential part of the home and its environment. We recognized three groups of citizens, namely, a utilitarian group (19 %), native group (21 %) and neutral group (60 %). The utilitarian group prefers to grow useful plants, such as for medicine or food. The neutral group does not indicate a preference for particular attributes of plants, which could be an indicator of the extinction of the experience with nature. Most of the participants do not know the origin of the species they grow.However, even when knowledge of native flora is limited (X = 0.96; max = 3.0), citizens recognize the intrinsic value of these species and would be willing to conserve them in their gardens (X = 4.35; max = 7.0). This willingness is also motivated by the set of benefits provided by native plants (e.g., ornamental, ecological, structural or emotional). Greater knowledge of native flora in the native group can be attributed to familiarity; therefore, the presence of these species in residential sidewalk gardens could encourage preferences and decisions aimed at promoting the conservation of local plant diversity.","[Guerrero-Leiva, Nicole] Univ Chile, Fac Forest Sci & Conservat Nat, Master Program Wild Areas & Nat Conservat, Santiago, Chile; [Cerda, Claudia; Bidegain, Inigo] Univ Chile, Fac Forest Sci & Conservat Nat, Dept Forest Management & Environm, Santiago, Chile; [Bidegain, Inigo] Univ Autonorna Madrid, Fac Sci, Dept Ecol, Social Ecol Syst Lab, Madrid, Spain; [Bidegain, Inigo] Univ Amer, Inst Nat Sci, Providencia, Chile",nguerrero@ug.uchile.cl,47,0,0,ELSEVIER GMBH,MUNICH,"HACKERBRUCKE 6, 80335 MUNICH, GERMANY",1618-8667,URBAN FOR URBAN GREE,Urban For.

Projects are actioned at all stakeholder levels, with many projects claiming success. However, debate over what constitutes success in the context of ecological restoration is long-running. Local communities commonly collaborate with government agencies in restoration projects, with many taking on responsibilities for project management. This study surveyed restoration practitioners in New Zealand at both community and agency levels to explore perceptions of what constitutes restoration success, and how this is measured. We found all stakeholders perceived their projects to be successful, although different perceptions of determinants and measures of success were evident. Agencies with ecological management responsibilities claim to follow systems-level attributes of success although monitoring is often limited to standards that are the easiest to measure. Community-based practitioners identify with gains in ecosystem structure, but their measurements of success tend to be of species-focused standards, possibly because of the ease by which such outcomes can be measured and, especially for New Zealand, focused by widespread publicity about threatened species and the impact of invasive species. Also, for long-running projects, perceptions of success may shift as ecological milestones are achieved. Although all restoration stakeholders aspire to universal outcomes of improved ecological status, for many community-based participants, social motivation, and rewards may be as important as their environmental stewardship intentions. We highlight the need to recognize the scientific and social duality of modern ecological restoration, particularly as community engagement is an explicit aspiration of the United Nations Decade on Ecosystem Restoration 2021-2030.","[Galbraith, Mel] Unitec Inst Technol, Sch Environm & Anim Sci, Private Bag 92025, Auckland 1142, New Zealand; [Towns, David R.; Bollard, Barbara] Auckland Univ Technol, Sch Sci, Private Bag 92006, Auckland 1142, New Zealand; [MacDonald, Edith A.] Dept Conservat, 18-32 Manners St, Wellington 6011, New Zealand",mgalbraith@unitec.ac.nz,95,1,1,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1061-2971,RESTOR ECOL,Restor.

A total of 686 valid samples were obtained. A logit model was used to confirm whether income from community-based ecotourism (CBET) could enhance households' conservation behavior. The results show that households prefer three types of conservation practices, and CBET could significantly improve the income of households engaged in it. Income from CBET has motivated local households to participate in conservation activities; however, but the effects are different. In all three conservation activities, income from CBET has shown significant effects on promoting forest maintenance and protection activities, but not on reforestation ones.

Many of these fishes are vital to the food security of rural and indigenous communities. However, human impacts on coastal Arctic habitats, as well as climate change, weaken ecosystem resiliency and threaten the sustainability of fish stocks as a component of local food security. Identifying how habitat characteristics influence fish ecology may allow for predictions of changes in fish abundance and availability in response to these threats, and may help illuminate strategies for responding to negative impacts. Consequently, we endeavored to link habitat characteristics likely to be most-impacted by climate change to fish assemblage trophic metrics in four lagoons within Cape Krusenstern National Monument, Alaska where subsistence fishing commonly occurs. This was done through calculating trophic metrics including mean nitrogen (delta N-15) and carbon (delta C-13) stable isotope values from fish muscle tissue samples collected from the study lagoons. Lagoon habitat characteristics were quantified including ocean connectivity, freshwater input, and surface area using satellite imagery. Finally, associations between fish assemblage trophic metrics and habitat characteristics were evaluated using linear regressions, and trophic metrics were compared between lagoons with ANOVA and Tukey post-hoc tests. Model results showed that increased freshwater input resulted in longer duration of lagoon ocean connectivity. Additionally, longer duration of ocean connectivity was associated with an increase in mean delta N-15 and delta C-13 across all lagoon fish species. Finally, there were significant species-specific differences in fish trophic metrics among lagoons with varying habitat characteristics. Overall, freshwater input and ocean connectivity of coastal Arctic lagoons appear to be important drivers of fish trophic ecology, and should be carefully monitored in the face of anticipated changes in the region, to conserve important subsistence harvest species.","[Fraley, Kevin M.; Robards, Martin D.; Smith, Beatrice] Wildlife Conservat Soc, Arctic Beringia Program, 3550 Airport Way,Suite 5, Fairbanks, AK 99709 USA; [Rogers, Matthew C.; Vollenweider, Johanna] NOAA, Alaska Fisheries Sci Ctr, 17109 Pt Lena Loop Rd, Juneau, AK 99801 USA; [Whiting, Alex] Environm Program, 600 Fifth Ave, Kotzebue, AK 99752 USA; [Jones, Tahzay] Natl Pk Serv, 240 W 5th Ave, Anchorage, AK 99501 USA",kfraley@wcs.org,59,1,1,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0722-4060,POLAR BIOL,Polar Biol.,2021,,

A total of 78 semi-structured interviews with heads of households were conducted. We found that both communities carried out practices and held beliefs associated with conservation, such as protecting trees and animal species considered sacred or perceived as beneficial for human life in terms of water provision and agricultural production. In addition to traditional ceremonies that respond to extreme climatic events such as drought and flood, other adaptation strategies used by the communities include moving to neighboring areas in search of better living conditions and using forest products in times of scarcity. We discuss that the management of the park should be agreed on, in a shared way, between local communities and conservation agents to ensure that these areas continue to perform the ecological, subsistence, and spiritual functions required.

The extant PA network is constrained by land availability and exacerbates cultural, political, and social conflicts over access to resources. Consequently, the importance of private lands in playing a complementary role in conservation is being widely recognized. Voluntary conservation programs that encourage private landowners to adopt biodiversity-friendly agricultural practices have emerged worldwide. Landowners' willingness to participate in these programs is critical to attaining landscape-level biodiversity conservation. We adopted a multidisciplinary approach, combining economic theory of rational choice and social choice theory to explain decision making. Using a stated preference choice experiment method, we examined the role of program design and influence of demographic, economic, and socio-psychological variables on landowners' willingness to enroll in voluntary, incentive-based agroforestry programs. In 2018-2019, we surveyed 602 landowners in the buffer area of Pench Tiger Reserve, India. Landowners' willingness to engage in agroforestry depended on the amount of land to be enrolled, program duration, and incentive amount. Landowners' socio-economic characteristics, attitudes, self-efficacy, and social norms also influenced their willingness to participate. On average, landowners required Rs. 66,000 (ca. $940 USD) per acre per year to modify their land use and adopt agroforestry. Our study demonstrates that integrating voluntary agroforestry programs into India's rural development policy may allow biodiversity conservation to be balanced with agricultural productivity in buffer areas surrounding PAs. We call for a new approach that recognizes farmers as stakeholders in conservation and in creating resilient landscapes that support biodiversity and preserve livelihoods.","[Puri, Mahi; Loiselle, Bette A.] Univ Florida, Dept Wildlife Ecol & Conservat, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Puri, Mahi; Karanth, Krithi K.] Ctr Wildlife Studies, Bengaluru, India; [Pienaar, Elizabeth F.] Univ Georgia, Warnell Sch Forestry & Nat Resources, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Pienaar, Elizabeth F.] Univ Pretoria, Mammal Res Inst, Pretoria, South Africa; [Karanth, Krithi K.] Duke Univ, Nicholas Sch Environm, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Loiselle, Bette A.] Univ Florida, Ctr Latin Amer Studies, Gainesville, FL USA",,76,2,2,RESILIENCE ALLIANCE,WOLFVILLE,"ACADIA UNIV, BIOLOGY DEPT, WOLFVILLE, NS B0P 1X0, CANADA",1708-3087,ECOL SOC,Ecol.

Here, we provide our findings on the knowledge of the Bilar local community about the Philippine tarsier (Tarsius [Carlito] syrichta) and its population endangerment risk. From October 2016 to November 2017 we conducted interviews with 325 residents from five villages in Bilar, Bohol Island, the Philippines. Tarsiers, though correctly recognized as such by the majority of interviewees, were infrequently sighted in the area, mainly by men, local resource suppliers and villagers in forested areas. Despite a high general knowledge of the species, its ecology and conservation are less well known, with word-of-mouth and personal experience being important sources of information. The species is generally not perceived by locals as endangered, and positive conservation attitudes prevail. Nevertheless, hunting in the area is widespread, and tarsiers are captured either for sale, to be kept as pets or trafficked to tourist facilities or foreigners. The Philippine tarsier, as a charismatic animal, has the potential to be an effective 'flagship species' for promoting conservation efforts. To strengthen the species' conservation, we recommend involving forest resources suppliers in research activities and wildlife tour services, continuing teacher training to ensure that school education emphasizes the ecological and aesthetic values of the Philippine tarsiers, and enhancing the image of this primate, particularly in the digital context, to improve tarsier welfare in captivity.","[Wojciechowski, Filip J.; Kaszycka, Katarzyna A.] Adam Mickiewicz Univ, Inst Human Biol & Evolut, Uniwersytetu Poznanskiego 6, PL-61614 Poznan, Poland; [Wojciechowski, Filip J.] Wings Serenity Inc, City Of Tagbilaran, Bohol, Philippines; [Otadoy, Julie B.] Univ San Carlos, Dept Biol, Cebu, Cebu, Philippines",philip.wojciechowski@gmail.com,74,0,0,ELSEVIER GMBH,MUNICH,"HACKERBRUCKE 6, 80335 MUNICH, GERMANY",1617-1381,J NAT CONSERV,J.

The number and relative abundance of species in different types of ecological strategies actually forms an ecological strategy spectrum in a community. Logging is a widespread driver of forest degradation, severely influencing the composition of communities and the ecological strategy spectra in forest ecosystems. Understanding effects of logging on the ecological strategy composition of communities is vital to biodiversity conservation and efficient restoration of degraded forest ecosystems. Yet, the knowledge of how ecological strategies of different communities respond to varying types and intensities of disturbances in tropical forests are largely unknown. Here, by establishing forest dynamics plots (FDPs) in communities experienced increasing logging intensities (no logging (old-growth (OG)), selective logging (SL), and clear-cutting (CL) and measuring plant functional traits in a tropical montane rain forest, we compared the changes in ecological strategies of these stands by using Grime's competitor, stress-tolerator, ruderal (CSR) scheme and by StrateFy ordination method based on measurements of three plant functional traits (Leaf area (LA), leaf dry matter content (LDMC), and specific leaf area (SLA)). Results showed that strategy number increased and ecological strategy spectra of communities changed significantly with increasing logging intensity: the proportion of S-selected strategies decreased while those of C- and R-selected strategies increased with increasing logging intensity. Community-weighted mean CSR (CWM-CSR) strategies of stands shifted from S to the C & R direction, i.e. CWM-C and CWM-R values increased and CWM-S values decreased with increasing logging intensity. Our findings suggest that logging intensity should be carefully controlled in harvesting planning, so that the recovery of species assemblages with multiple ecological strategies can be assured and the ecosystem services from these biodiverse forests can be provided sustainably.","[Han, Xin; Huang, Jihong; Yao, Jie; Xu, Yue; Ding, Yi; Zang, Runguo] Chinese Acad Forestry, Res Inst Forest Ecol Environm & Protect, Key Lab Forest Ecol & Environm Natl Forestry & Gr, Beijing 100091, Peoples R China; [Han, Xin; Huang, Jihong; Yao, Jie; Xu, Yue; Ding, Yi; Zang, Runguo] Nanjing Forestry Univ, Coinnovat Ctr Sustainable Forestry Southern China, Nanjing 210037, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",zangrung@caf.ac.cn,47,1,1,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1470-160X,ECOL INDIC,Ecol.

The aim of this study was to establish conservation projections for the whole of the Irrawaddy River system, based on fish diversity patterns, human impact, and environmental change. The Irrawaddy River is one of the five largest rivers in Southeast Asia. Although it has very high diversity of fish species and species endemism, our understanding of resident fish status remains poor. Based on 1,726 field survey and 1,056 database records, 470 fish species and their distribution patterns (i.e. alpha, beta, threatened species, and endemic species diversities) in sub-basins of the Irrawaddy drainage were identified. Canonical correspondence analysis of diversity and environmental patterns indicated that climatic factors had the largest effect on diversity, compatible with the species-energy theory. Fish conservation priorities of sub-basins were evaluated based on diversity patterns and human impact. The delta and Manipur basin regions were highlighted as areas of focus for future fish diversity conservation, and the importance of connectivity in the Irrawaddy main stem was demonstrated. The results of this study will be valuable for future management of the Irrawaddy basin and as a reference for other river basins when implementing protection strategies for fish diversity.

We do not need a thermometer. We need a fire hose. (P. 102, Janzen and Hallwachs, 2019). Insectivorous birds are declining widely, and for diverse reasons. Tropical insectivorous birds, more than 60% of all tropical birds, are particularly sensitive to human disturbances including habitat loss and fragmentation, intensive agriculture and pesticide use, and climate change; and the mechanisms are incompletely understood. This review addresses multiple, complementary and sometimes synergistic explanations for tropical insectivore declines, by categorizing explanations into ultimate vs. proximate, and direct versus indirect. Ultimate explanations are diverse human Anthropocene activities and the evolutionary history of these birds. This evolutionary history, synthesized by the Biotic Challenge Hypothesis (BCH), explains tropical insectivorous birds' vulnerabilities to many proximate threats as a function of both these birds' evolutionary feeding specialization and poor dispersal capacity. These traits were favored evolutionarily by both the diversity of insectivorous clades competing intensely for prey and co-evolution with arthropods over long evolutionary time periods. More proximate, ecological threats include bottom-up forces like declining insect populations, top-down forces like meso-predator increases, plus the Anthropocene activities underlying these factors, especially habitat loss and fragmentation, agricultural intensification, and climate change. All these conditions peak in the lowland, mainland Neotropics, where insectivorous bird declines have been repeatedly documented, but also occur in other tropical locales and continents. This multiplicity of interacting evolutionary and ecological factors informs conservation implications and recommendations for tropical insectivorous birds: (1) Why they are so sensitive to global change phenomena is no longer enigmatic, (2) distinguishing ultimate versus proximate stressors matters, (3) evolutionary life-histories predispose these birds to be particularly sensitive to the Anthropocene, (4) tropical regions and continents vary with respect to these birds' ecological sensitivity, (5) biodiversity concepts need stronger incorporation of species' evolutionary histories, (6) protecting these birds will require more, larger reserves for multiple reasons, and (7) these birds have greater value than generally recognized.","[Sherry, Thomas W.] Tulane Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, New Orleans, LA 70118 USA",tsherry@tulane.edu,212,2,2,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",2296-701X,FRONT ECOL EVOL,Front.

Shellfish conservation and restoration projects have emerged to combat and reverse this decline but are hindered by a scattered knowledge base and a lack of evidence-based best practice. To address this concern, we conducted a systematic review of English-language peer-reviewed articles studying the impacts of conservation-based actions on reef-building bivalves. A comprehensive search identified 281 relevant articles for the review. Articles were then categorized to establish the temporal and geographic extent of shellfish reef conservation research, quantify collaboration within the field, and develop a systematic map of the distribution of evidence across intervention and outcome categories. The results confirm a substantial increase in shellfish reef research with 72% of articles published since 2010. However, this evidence base is uneven, with 80% of research occurring in the United States and Northern Europe, 71% on only oysters, and 58% by only academia-affiliated authors. The systematic map of linkages and gaps also reveals disparities in the evidence base, as ecological interventions and outcomes are undertaken and measured at a far greater rate than social interventions and outcomes, despite evidence that social aspects are critical components of conservation work. To ensure future conservation practitioners have evidence that is relevant to the circumstances of their projects, this evidence base needs to be diversified and we offer recommendations on reprioritizations for future research as well as a comprehensive database of existing shellfish conservation papers.","[Toone, Trevyn A.; Benjamin, Emilee D.; Jeffs, Andrew; Hillman, Jenny R.] Univ Auckland, Inst Marine Sci, 160 Goat Isl Rd, Leigh 0985, New Zealand; [Toone, Trevyn A.; Benjamin, Emilee D.; Handley, Sean] Natl Inst Water & Atmospher Res, 217 Akersten St, Port Nelson 7010, Nelson, New Zealand; [Hunter, Rebecca] Nelson Marlborough Inst Technol, Dept Aquaculture, 322 Hardy St, Nelson 7010, New Zealand; [Jeffs, Andrew] Univ Auckland, Sch Biol Sci, 3A Symonds St, Auckland 1010, New Zealand",ttoo112@aucklanduni.ac.nz,59,0,0,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1061-2971,RESTOR ECOL,Restor.

This is the case of Jacobaea auricula, an Iberian gypsohalophytic species with biological, ecological, and conservation interest. Genetic-based criteria were used to preserve the highest possible percentage of the species' genetic pool as well as to dispose of a set of genotypes for translocation and/or reinforcement planning of degraded populations. Relevant Genetics Units for Conservation (RGUCs) were selected as in situ conservation planning. As a complementary ex situ measure, the optimal contribution for the populations to maximize the genetic pool within each genetic cluster was calculated. To preserve the maximum genetic diversity and the highest percentage of rare AFLP bands possible, eight RGUCs were selected; the ex situ conservation design included twenty-one populations, gathering all haplotypes and ribotypes.

Animal culture was the focus of a ground-breaking resolution under the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS), an international treaty operating under the UN Environment Programme. Here, we synthesize existing evidence to demonstrate how social learning and animal culture interact with processes important to conservation management. Specifically, we explore how social learning might influence population viability and be an important resource in response to anthropogenic change, and provide examples of how it can result in phenotypically distinct units with different, socially learnt behavioural strategies. While identifying culture and social learning can be challenging, indirect identification and parsimonious inferences may be informative.

As an ecologically important savanna species, valued both culturally and economically, it is imperative to understand if resource use is sustainable. Population stability can be understood by comparing tree density and size-class distribution (SCD) profiles across land-use types (homestead yards, fields and rangelands) in non-conservation savanna social-ecological systems. Marula tree population data were gathered in rangeland transects and randomly selected fields and yards from four human settlements in the Bushbuckridge municipality of northeastern South Africa. Total density was lowest in fields (mean ? SE = 7.4 ? 0.7 trees/ha) and highest in homestead yards (mean ? SE = 25.7 ? 4.1 trees/ha). Social data revealed that elevated seedling and sapling population densities in yards is linked to discarded kernels from marula beer making. Total densities increased in yards over a 15-year period but declined in rangelands, with female densities remaining almost constant across land-use types over this period. This is an important finding as it is a strong indication of socially-mediated population structure changes, confirming that combined cultural and economic value can lead to examples of species conservation. In this case, the prioritization of female trees as the distinguished fruit producers. SCD revealed weak recruitment in fields and rangelands. Diminished regeneration, combined with overharvesting for fuelwood in rangelands and felling trees in yards, is likely to negatively impact population stability in the longterm. Understanding resource conservation and degradation in the context of important non-timber forest products (NTFPs) is a key knowledge challenge, with this study serving as an updated inventory benchmark for marula populations in the area. Important lessons learned here can be applied to other social-ecological contexts where a key natural resource is responsible for sustaining livelihoods.","[Blair, Amy M.; Thompson, Dave, I; Grab, Stefan] Univ Witwatersrand, Sch Geog Archaeol & Environm Studies, ZA-2050 Braamfontein, South Africa; [Blair, Amy M.; Thompson, Dave, I] Kruger Natl Pk, South African Environm Observat Network, Limpopo, South Africa; [Twine, Wayne C.] Univ Witwatersrand, Sch Anim Plant & Environm Sci, ZA-2050 Braamfontein, South Africa",amym@icon.co.za,68,1,1,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0378-1127,FOREST ECOL MANAG,For.

We identified five prey species. Most of the snow leopard diet consisted of wild ungulates (85.8%), mostly bharal (60.8%). Yak (14.2%) was the only livestock species in the scats. Livestock depredation was higher during summer and differed markedly among four protected areas characterized by various wildlife densities and human activities.

In 1996, a committee of prominent USA crayfish biologists warned of a crayfish imperilment plight and neglect of the fauna by natural resources agencies. It is unclear whether crayfish conservation has been prioritized by those agencies in the intervening decades. Our objective was to evaluate the status of crayfish conservation and management in 50 USA and 13 Canadian fish and wildlife agencies through a telephone survey. Fifty-one percent of agencies employed biologists to conduct crayfish work, mostly in the southern USA, and focused on threats (e.g., invasive species) or species' distributions and conservation status. Of the 32 agencies working on crayfish, 59% considered them a priority, but 53% acknowledged insufficient funding. The most commonly cited information needs were threats, species compositions (native and introduced), distributions, conservation status assessments, and ecology. We report an encouraging but limited increase in agencies working on crayfish over the past two decades. Copyright (c) 2021 by The Author(s). Published by the International Association of Astacology.

Here, we used a systematic approach (MARXAN) for i) evaluating if the current Natura 2000 network in the Alboran Sea (western Mediterranean Sea), initially proposed to protect the common bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) and priority habitats, is also spatially protecting the endangered common dolphin (Delphinus delphis), and ii) identifying additional marine areas that should be protected to reach adequate conservation targets for the common dolphin. While the current Natura 2000 network encompass ca. 22% of predicted abundances for common dolphins, this percentage might be enhanced by protecting coastal areas nearby the Strait of Gibraltar. However, dolphins and fisheries largely overlap spatially nearby the coastline, and only segregate in offshore areas that represent the marginal distribution of the species. Thus, conservation decision-makers must achieve a trade-off between cetacean conservation and fisheries by combining an area-based approach (i.e., new protected areas close to the Strait of Gibraltar) together with a basin-wide threat-based approach (e.g., regulation of fisheries).","[Gimenez, Joan] Univ Coll Cork, Environm Res Inst, MaREI Ctr, Cork, Ireland; [Gimenez, Joan] Univ Coll Cork, Sch Biol Earth & Environm Sci BEES, Cork, Ireland; [Canadas, Ana] ALNILAM Res & Conservat, Pradillos 29, Madrid 28491, Spain; [Canadas, Ana] Duke Univ, Nicholas Sch Environm, Marine Geospatial Ecol Lab, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [de Stephanis, Renaud] Conservat Informat & Res Cetaceans CIRCE, Cabeza Manzaneda 3, Cadiz 11390, Spain; [de Stephanis, Renaud] Ctr Oceanog Santander, Inst Espanol Oceanog IEO, Promontorio San Martin S-N, Santander 39004, Spain; [Ramirez, Francisco] CSIC, Inst Ciencies Mar ICM, Dept Renewable Marine Resources, Passeig Maritim Barceloneta 37-49, Barcelona 08003, Spain; [Gimenez, Joan] CSIC, Dept Conservat Biol, Estn Biol Donana EBD, Amer Vespucio 26, Seville 41092, Spain",gimenez.verdugo@gmail.com,87,0,0,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0141-1136,MAR ENVIRON RES,Mar.

Many international development projects have started to promote Conservation Agriculture globally, in this perspective. Conservation Agriculture (CA) is mainly comprised of three interlinked principles, viz. soil disturbance to the null or minimal, permanent cover on soil using mulch or crop residues, and crop diversification. Day by day CA is getting more and more attention of farming community throughout the world. In 2015-2016 season conservation agriculture was adopted on about 180 MHA of cropland, about 12.5% of the total global cropland, i.e. 69% more than 2008-2009 in the world. The adoption behaviour of farmers has been reviewed in this literature. Key influencers on smallholdings, gender dimension and knowledge network, institutional and policy context are also theoretically presented in relation to CA system. Harmonizing this requires an understanding of the complex network of adopter-CA technology-adoption behaviour and global or national level policy formulation as well as strategic farm-level management.","[Chatterjee, Riti; Acharya, Sankar Kumar] Bidhan Chandra Krishi Viswavidyalaya, Dept Agr Extens, Fac Agr, Mohanpur 741252, W Bengal, India",ritichatterjee2015@gmail.com; acharya09sankar@gmail.com,124,0,0,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0960-3115,BIODIVERS CONSERV,Biodivers.

Global climate change is predicted to affect bumble bee ecology including habitat suitability and geographic distribution. Our study aims to estimate the impact of projected climate change on 18 Mesoamerican bumble bee species. We used ecological niche modeling (ENM) using current and future climate emissions scenarios (representative concentration pathway 4.5, 6.0, and 8.5) and models (CCSM4, HadGEM2-AO, and MIROC-ESM-CHEM). Regardless of the scenario and model applied, our results suggest that all bumble bee species are predicted to undergo a reduction in their potential distribution and habitat suitability due to projected climate change. ENMs based on low emission scenarios predict a distribution loss ranging from 7% to 67% depending on the species for the year 2050. Furthermore, we discovered that the reduction of bumble bee geographic range shape will be more evident at the margins of their distribution. The reduction of suitable habitat is predicted to be accompanied by a 100-500 m upslope change in altitude and 1-581 km shift away from the current geographic centroid of a species' distribution. On average, protected natural areas in Mesoamerica cover similar to 14% of each species' current potential distribution, and this proportion is predicted to increase to similar to 23% in the high emission climate change scenarios. Our models predict that climate change will reduce Mesoamerican bumble bee habitat suitability, especially for rare species, by reducing their potential distribution ranges and suitability. The small proportion of current and future potential distribution falling in protected natural areas suggests that such areas will likely have marginal contribution to bumble bee habitat conservation. Our results have the capacity to inform stakeholders in designing effective landscape management for bumble bees, which may include developing restoration plans for montane pine oak forests habitats and native flowering plants.","[Martinez-Lopez, Oscar; Vandame, Remy] Colegio Frontera, Dept Agr Soc & Ambiente, Carretera Panamer & Perifer S-N, San Cristobal de las Casa 29290, Chiapas, Mexico; [Martinez-Lopez, Oscar; Enriquez, Eunice] Univ San Carlos, Fac Ciencias Quim & Farm, Ctr Estudios Conservacionistas CECON, Unidad Conocimiento Uso & Valorac Biodiversidad, Guatemala City, Guatemala; [Koch, Jonathan B.] USDA ARS, Pacific West Area Pollinating Insects Biol Manage, Logan, UT USA; [Martinez-Morales, Miguel A.] Colegio Frontera, Dept Conservac Biodiversidad, San Cristobal de las Casa, Chiapas, Mexico; [Navarrete-Gutierrez, Dario] Colegio Frontera, Dept Observac & Estudio Tierra, Atmosfera & Oceano Grp Ecol Paisaje & Sustentabil, San Cristobal de las Casa, Chiapas, Mexico",ogmartinez@ecosur.edu.mx,102,3,3,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1354-1013,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

To conserve connectivity, careful landscape planning is necessary, which strongly relies on remotely sensed land cover maps. Here, we present a remote sensing-based framework that efficiently identifies priority locations for connectivity conservation. We applied the framework in the Kilombero catchment and development cluster of the Southern Agricultural Growth Corridor (SAGCOT) in Tanzania, where new agricultural development projects could act as barriers for connectivity. Using satellite imagery from Sentinel-1 and 2, we mapped the mixture of mountain and lowland land covers and habitats with an overall accuracy of 75%. Then, we assessed ecological connectivity to predict African elephant corridors and prioritize them in two ways. First, we identified elephant corridors that contribute the most to current landscape connectivity, and second, we identified those whose restoration would significantly enhance landscape functionality and improve the current connectivity level. We mapped 214 potential elephant corridors, identified 43 of them as priority for conservation, and 43 as target for restoration. Our model predicted four already known corridor areas in and around the Kilombero valley floodplain, and other important corridors not yet identified by previous studies in the south of the basin. Priority elephant corridors inside the floodplain showed narrow widths and low permeability, indicating low functionality in the connectivity network. Nevertheless, the abundance of priority corridors for restoration suggests that connectivity could be recovered if the recommended measures are applied during SAGCOT planning and implementation process. Our findings demonstrate the possibilities of combining multispectral and radar data for guiding biodiversity management in development corridors and for assessing ecological connectivity worldwide.","[Cisneros-Araujo, Pablo; Mateo-Sanchez, Maria C.] Univ Politecn Madrid, ETSI Montes Forestal & Medio Nat, Ciudad Univ S-N, Madrid 28040, Spain; [Ramirez-Lopez, Miguel] Tragsatec, Gerencia Desarrollo Rural & Polit Forestal, Julian Camarillo 6B, Madrid 28037, Spain; [Juffe-Bignoli, Diego; Burgess, Neil D.] UN Environm Programme World Conservat Monitoring, 219 Huntington Rd, Cambridge CB3 0DL, England; [Juffe-Bignoli, Diego] Univ Kent, Durrell Inst Conservat & Ecol, Canterbury, Kent, England; [Fensholt, Rasmus] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Geosci & Nat Resource Management, Oster Voldgade 10, DK-1350 Copenhagen, Denmark; [Muro, Javier] Univ Bonn, Ctr Remote Sensing Land Surfaces ZFL, D-53113 Bonn, Germany; [Burgess, Neil D.] Univ Copenhagen, Nat Hist Museum, CMEC, DK-2100 Copenhagen, Denmark",pablo.cisneros.araujo@upm.es,76,3,3,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN, NJ 07030 USA",,REMOTE SENS ECOL CON,Remote Sens.

We trace these beliefs to a long-standing, gendered sociocultural convention and argue that the disparagement of emotion as a source of moral understanding is both empirically and morally problematic. According to the current scientific and philosophical understanding, reason and emotion are better understood as partners, rather than opposites. Nonetheless, the two have historically been seen as separate, with reason elevated in association with masculinity and emotion (especially nurturing emotion) dismissed or delegitimated in association with femininity. These associations can be situated in a broader, dualistic, and hierarchical logic used to maintain power for a dominant male (White, able-bodied, upper class, heterosexual) human class. We argue that emotion should be affirmed by conservationists for the novel and essential insights it contributes to conservation ethics. We consider the specific example of compassion and characterize it as an emotional experience of interdependence and shared vulnerability. This experience highlights conservationists' responsibilities to individual beings, enhancing established and widely accepted beliefs that conservationists have a duty to protect populations, species, and ecosystems (or biodiversity).

Because environmental issues involve social and ecological complexities, there is a need to create educational frameworks whereby students learn how to integrate and apply knowledge from both natural and social sciences. To explore the interplay between undergraduate students' conceptions of NOS for ecology and sociology and how students apply discipline-specific knowledge to a socio-ecological issue, we administered a NOS evaluative survey and analyzed data from student modeling practices within the context of a course-based undergraduate research experience (CURE). We found that although students held similar conceptions of the NOS for both ecology and sociology disciplines, there were notable differences in how often and how accurately students applied discipline-specific knowledge when modeling a socio-ecological system.

Deserta Grande (Madeira Archipelago, Portugal), the locus typicus, where in 2006 close to 30 plants were detected with a high variation of age/size between individuals comprising both fully flowering and non-flowering adult plants as well as seedlings, and thus corresponding to a healthy population. This study assesses population size, age and plant size, and genetic, as well as floristic diversity. The total area of the site corresponds to approximately 1500 square meters. Ten individuals were detected, all corresponding to young seedlings not exceeding 15 cm high, and exhibiting approximately the same size and numbers of leaves (4?8). No adult plants or remains of adult plants were seen. Ecological data and direct herbivory evidence suggest that perennial plants are subjected to elimination during the short summer by the feral goat population. Molecular data based on ISSR markers show that the nine sampled individuals (out of ten individuals found) are genetically identical, possibly resulting from one parental plant. Results clearly suggest that Musschia isambertoi is very close to extinction. Urgent conservation measures are imperative and should include the immediate fencing of the population followed by the elimination of feral goats from Deserta Grande. The elimination of feral goats was initiated in 1996 (LIFE95 NAT/P/000125, 383,467.00 ?) but stopped due to inappropriate conservation policies of the former Services of the Natural Park of Madeira.","[de Sequeira, M.

Yet, bats are frequently associated with infectious human diseases such as SARS, MERS, and Ebola. As early as the end of January 2020, several virological studies have suggested bats as a probable origin for SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19. How does the public view the role of bats in COVID-19? Here we report pilot data collected shortly after the outbreak of COVID-19 using two online surveys, combined with a conservation intervention experiment, primarily on people who are receiving or have received higher education in China. We found that 84% of the participants of an online survey (n = 13 589) have misunderstood the relationship between bats and COVID-19, which strengthened negative attitudes towards bats. Knowledge of bats, gender, and education level of the participants affected their attitudes towards bats. Participants who indicated a better knowledge of bats had a more positive attitude towards bats. The proportion of female participants who had negative attitudes towards bats was higher than that of male participants. Participants with a higher education level indicated a more positive attitude towards bats after the outbreak of COVID-19. A specially prepared bat conservation lecture improved peoples' knowledge of bats and the positive attitudes, but failed to correct the misconception that bats transmit SARS-CoV-2 to humans directly. We suggest that the way virologists frame the association of bats with diseases, the countless frequently inaccurate media coverages, and the natural perceptual bias of bats carrying and transmitting diseases to humans contributed to the misunderstandings. This probably led to a rise in the events of evicting bats from dwellings and structures by humans and the legislative proposal for culling disease-relevant wildlife in China. A better understanding of the relationship between disease, wildlife and human health could help guide the public and policymakers in an improved program for bat conservation.","[Lu, Manman; Wang, Xindong; Ye, Huan; Wang, Huimin; Qiu, Shan; Zhang, Hongmao; Luo, Jinhong] Cent China Normal Univ, Inst Evolut & Ecol, Sch Life Sci, Wuhan 430079, Peoples R China; [Liu, Ying; Feng, Jiang] Northeast Normal Univ, Jilin Prov Key Lab Anim Resource Conservat & Util, Changchun 130117, Peoples R China; [Feng, Jiang] Jilin Agr Univ, Coll Life Sci, Changchun 130118, Peoples R China",liuy252@nenu.edu.cn; jluo@ccnu.edu.cn; fengj@nenu.edu.cn,60,13,13,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0006-3207,BIOL CONSERV,Biol.

I proceed in three parts. First, drawing on insights from post- and decolonial studies, critical geography, environmental history and political ecology, I highlight three problems that underpin a landscape way of seeing nature-society relations: depoliticization, simplification/ decomplexification, and representation. Second, to illustrate the colonial legacy of the contemporary landscape approach to nature conservation, I revisit the global history of landscapism - the double movement of colonizing landscapes/landscaping colonies. This double movement began with the internal colonization of European landscapes (autonomous political communities), and continued through the landscaping of (settler-)colonies by Europeans outside of their homelands. Third, through the contemporary case of a landscape conservation initiative in Tanzania (the so-called Tarangire-Manyara Ecosystem), I illustrate the implications of the double movement in the colonial present of African conservation. I conclude with a few remarks on what decolonization of conservation would have to entail in scientific research and practice.","[Bluwstein, Jevgeniy] Univ Fribourg, Dept Geosci, Human Geog, Fribourg, Switzerland",,156,0,0,UNIV ARIZONA LIBRARIES,TUCSON,"UNIV ARIZONA LIBRARIES, TUCSON, AZ 85721 USA",1073-0451,J POLIT ECOL,J.

It is only recently that critical scholars have begun to demonstrate how colonial legacies interact with market-based conservation policies in ways that increase their risk of failure, deepen on-the-ground inequalities and cement global injustices. In this article, we take further this emerging body of work by showing how contemporary, market-based conservation initiatives extend the temporalities and geographies of colonialism, undergird long-standing hegemonies and perpetuate exploitative power relations in the governing of nature-society relations, particularly in the Global South. Reflecting on ethnographic insights from six different field sites across countries of the Global South, we argue that decolonization is an important and necessary step in confronting some of the major weaknesses of contemporary conservation and the wider socio-ecological crisis itself.

The Network for Conserving Central India (NCCI) provides a platform for such collaborations in a globally important tiger conservation region within a complex social-ecological system. Using the NCCI as an example, our study identifies indicators to track progress in collaborative landscape-level networks across four dimensions: the composition of the network; collaborative scientific output; dissemination of research outputs through social, electronic and print media; and participation in policy and decision-making bodies. The NCCI is primarily comprised of members of the scientific community, Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) and various levels of government. Since 2013, the NCCI members conducted research that predominantly addressed human-wildlife conflicts and human livelihood needs around protected areas (PAs), with less attention to forest ecology and climate. NGOs within the NCCI work closely with local communities and provide avenues for local engagement. Co-production of policies is an essential but challenging goal due to established hierarchies and top-down institutional structures. Our analyses highlight the NCCI's role as a knowledge platform and bridge among researchers, NGOs, and government, with significant opportunities for boundary work in the Science, Policy and Practice Interface (SPPI). A challenging and unfulfilled goal is the engagement of local communities to co-produce approaches that balance conservation, local livelihoods, and development.

The environs of the Hluhluwe-Imfolozi National Park are a violent environment, where the immediate violence of a poaching and antipoaching 'war' waged over fears of Rhinoceros extinction, is counter-posed to the slow violence permeating the lives of marginal rural residents affected by the externalities of coal mining. A range of struggles are waged against these challenges, but a hegemonic 'Biodiversity Economy' intervention has arisen, attended by projects aimed at territorializing conservation space and multiple-win scenarios. Based on four years of intermittent research in the area, this article critiques the territorialization of conservation, project outcomes, and commercialization efforts within the Umfozi Biodiversity Economy Node (UBEN). I contend that a biodiversity economy nodal approach extends neoliberal conservation strategies, and functions as a spatial aggregator to reterritorialize conservation land use over space and time. However, the findings suggest that, despite years of energy and investment there have only been limited individual successes in the UBEN, and a range of frustrations, compounded by COVID-19 complications. The analysis also highlights further costs and externalities of the initiative: as the UBEN exacerbates underlying tensions in Kwazulu-Natal's uneven conservation geography, and it aligns with problematic and often unrepresentative traditional authority structures and related accumulation networks. It is also complicit with the production of sacrificial spaces at the conservation-extraction nexus. In this context, I argue the UBEN is pyrrhic; that is, an outcome or goal strived for/achieved at too little reward and too high a cost. The article extends political-ecological critique of neoliberal conservation and the green economy to incorporate the framing and implementation of biodiversity economy nodal approaches - and their uneven and pyrrhic effects - in contested, crisis-ridden conservation contexts.","[Nel, Adrian] Univ Kwazulu Natal, Sch Agr Earth & Environm Sci, Geog, Durban, South Africa",nela@ukzn.ac.za,84,0,0,UNIV ARIZONA LIBRARIES,TUCSON,"UNIV ARIZONA LIBRARIES, TUCSON, AZ 85721 USA",1073-0451,J POLIT ECOL,J.

It is imperative to reliably identify factors that limit connectivity across heterogeneous, fragmented landscapes. Viewing connectivity as the persistence of movement in space from source to destination-along potential corridors simulated from correlated random walks-we adapt the dynamic occupancy modeling framework to present an approach to reliably quantify connectivity. This approach allowed us to estimate the probability of spatial persistence of movement along potential corridors, while accounting for imperfect detection of animal use of the matrix. We use simulations to test our model, and data from sign surveys of Asian elephant Elephas maximus space use in Garo Hills, Northeast India, as a practical application of the method. Distance to forests and ruggedness predominantly shaped elephant connectivity patterns. Negative effects of distance to forests were intensified at the onset of dispersal, and in the more disturbed part of our landscape. We mapped locations critical to maintaining connectivity in our study landscape. We demonstrate that the widely used occupancy modeling approach, when combined with appropriate field data collection, permits explicit assessment of matrix impacts on connectivity while accounting for imperfect detection of animal movement. In so doing, we highlight the value of the approach in enabling inference on where animals move, as well as why. Obtaining a reliable understanding of factors shaping connectivity is central to understanding and predicting species responses to environmental change, thereby facilitating effective long-term conservation in fragmented landscapes.","[Vasudev, Divya; Goswami, Varun R.] Conservat Initiat, Gauhati 781022, Assam, India; [Vasudev, Divya; Goswami, Varun R.] Ctr Wildlife Studies, Bengaluru 560042, Karnataka, India; [Vasudev, Divya] Wildlife Conservat Trust, Mumbai 400021, Maharashtra, India; [Goswami, Varun R.; Oli, Madan K.] Univ Florida, Sch Nat Resources & Environm, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Goswami, Varun R.; Oli, Madan K.] Univ Florida, Dept Wildlife Ecol & Conservat, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA",varunr.goswami@gmail.com,35,2,2,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0006-3207,BIOL CONSERV,Biol.

Political ecologists have warned that violent, militarized approaches are counter-productive, because they fail to address the root causes of poaching and may provide the moral justification for those already marginalized by conservation to hunt wildlife illegally. This is a powerful set of critiques, but scholars have yet to provide an empirically derived explanation of how and why militarized conservation might contribute to, rather than prevent, environmental harms. This lack of explanation emerges from a concerning scarcity of scholarly attention to the people who are actually living with militarized conservation. In response to the increased monitoring and arrests that accompanied the securitization of Mozambique's Limpopo National Park (LNP), Park residents expressed fear, anger, and resentment. Yet they continued to engage in the illegal subsistence-based practices of fishing and hunting in the face of mounting enforcements against these practices. In interviews and public demonstrations, residents consistently questioned the legitimacy of rangers' actions and authority, neutralizing the problem of their own potential involvement in illegal activities by focusing instead on the unjust and morally questionable behaviors of rangers. According to defiance theory, environmental harms will increase as the legitimacy of conservation policies, tactics, and authority decline. As defiance figures into and informs residents' decisions to continue to engage in subsistence-based practices, it may also motivate and justify people's involvement in the more lucrative and harmful activity of hunting threatened and endangered wildlife for the global trade. This article demonstrates why there is a need to fundamentally rethink the increased securitization of protected area conservation and addresses the need for improved understandings of human agency in the face of militarized conservation.","[Witter, Rebecca] Appalachian State Univ, Sustainable Dev, Boone, NC 28608 USA",witterre@appstate.edu,69,5,5,UNIV ARIZONA LIBRARIES,TUCSON,"UNIV ARIZONA LIBRARIES, TUCSON, AZ 85721 USA",1073-0451,J POLIT ECOL,J.

Ingredients derived from wild mammals are widely used in traditional remedies. Large datasets of traits, geographic ranges, and phylogeny are also available for mammals. Therefore, mammals are an ideal group in which to explore the ecological (e.g. range size, body mass) and evolutionary (i.e. shared ancestry) correlates of the use of animal-derived products in traditional medicine. 2. In a global analysis of correlates of the use of wild mammals in traditional medicine, we tested how life-history traits relate to the use of mammal products to treat disease. We compiled data from the primary literature about folk remedies based on mammals via a literature search using ISI Web of Knowledge, Scopus, and Google Scholar. Then, we used modern phylogenetic comparative methods to estimate phylogenetic signals in the diseases that mammal body parts are used to treat and to test whether geographic range size and body mass are related to medicinal use. We tested whether mammalian species that are used more in medicine are also those that are more threatened by extinction. 3. Our results show that 521 mammalian species are used to source products to treat 371 ailments. We found support for the hypothesis that phylogenetic relatedness correlates with the use of mammal-derived remedies in traditional medicines. Specifically, we confirm our hypotheses that closely related species are more similar in terms of their perceived medical versatility than distantly related species and are used to treat similar diseases. Furthermore, we demonstrated that large marsupials are more versatile and are used to treat more diseases than smaller marsupials. 4. In our database, 155 mammalian species are considered threatened (Vulnerable, Endangered, or Critically Endangered), and a further 46 are Near Threatened, suggesting that overexploitation for medicinal use could be an overlooked source of threat that should be considered in mammal species conservation assessments. We demonstrate that phylogenetic relatedness correlates with the use of mammalian species as remedies in traditional medicine, and urge future researchers to evaluate the negative effects of overexploitation of mammals for medical purposes. Such overexploitation could cause non-random extinction patterns in the mammalian tree of life.","[Alves, Romulo Romeu Nobrega] Univ Estadual Paraiba, Dept Biol, Av Baraunas 351,Campus Univ, BR-58109753 Campina Grande, PB, Brazil; [Alves, Romulo Romeu Nobrega] Univ Fed Paraiba Bodocongo, Dept Sistemat & Ecol, Posgrad Ciencias Biol Zool, BR-58051900 Joao Pessoa, PB, Brazil; [Borges, Anna Karolina Martins] Univ Fed Paraiba, Dept Sistemat & Ecol, Posgrad Ciencias Biol Zool, BR-58051900 Joao Pessoa, PB, Brazil; [Borges, Anna Karolina Martins] Univ Estadual Paraiba, Dept Biol, Programa Posgrad Etnobiol & Conservacao Nat, Av Baraunas 351,Campus Univ, BR-58109753 Campina Grande, PB, Brazil; [Barboza, Raynner Rilke Duarte] Univ Fed Roraima, Colegio Aplicacao CAP, Ave Capitao Ene Garces 2413 Aeroporto, BR-69310000 Boa Vista, Parana, Brazil; [Souto, Wedson Medeiros Silva] Fed Univ Piaui UFPI, Dept Biol, Lab Zool Wildlife Use & Conservat ZUCON, Campus Ministro Petronio Portella, BR-64049550 Teresina, Piaui, Brazil; [Goncalves-Souza, Thiago] Univ Fed Rural Pernambuco, Dept Biol, Lab Sintese Ecol & Conservacao Biodiversidade, Dept Biol, Rua Dom Manuel de Medeiros S-N, BR-52171900 Recife, PE, Brazil; [Provete, Diogo B.] Univ Fed Mato Grosso do Sul, Inst Biociencias, BR-79002970 Campo Grande, MS, Brazil; [Provete, Diogo B.] Gothenburg Global Biodivers Ctr, Box 100, S-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden; [Albuquerque, Ulysses Paulino] Univ Fed Pernambuco, Dept Bot, Lab Ecol & Evolucao Sistemas Socioecol LEA, Av Prof Moraes Rego 1235, BR-50670901 Recife, PE, Brazil",romulo_nobrega@yahoo.com.br; karolm26@hotmail.com; raynner@live.com; wedson@ufpi.edu.br; tgoncalves.souza@gmail.com; dbprovete@gmail.com; upa677@hotmail.com,77,3,3,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0305-1838,MAMMAL REV,Mammal Rev.,2021,,

We explored phenological patterns in Hainan Tropical Rainforest National Park (HNNP) in China and their major climatic and biotic drivers, based on phenological and distribution data for >2000 species from the Flora of Hainan. Specifically, we address the following questions: (1) What are the phenological patterns for all species in HNNP and for Hainan gibbon food plants only? (2) What are the environmental drivers of reproductive phenology? (3) Whether the flowering and fruiting dates are phylogenetic conserved? (4) Does reproductive phenology vary with functional groups, like growth forms, pollination modes and fruit types? Our results show flowering peaks in late spring and early summer, while fruiting phenology was concentrated during late summer and fall. Closely related species tend to have similar flowering and fruiting dates. The number of flowering species was primary controlled by mean maximum monthly temperature while minimum monthly temperature was the most important variable in shaping fruiting patterns of all species. For fruiting of gibbon food plants, mean monthly precipitation was the most important variable. Our study found January to May was food shortage period, which has important implications for Hainan gibbon conservation. We should take targeted ecological restoration by planting gibbon food species with phenologies between January and May, and take targeted provisioning to attract gibbons into a new habitat by providing fruits between January and May.

The influence of different parameters including socio-demographic, socio-economic and human-wildlife interactions on local communities opinions concerning wildlife conservation were examined. The respondents provided wide and diversified responses about the significance of wildlife for different purposes such as food consumption (hunting) to mixed concerns (aesthetic, moral and future values) and ecological balance. The responses were recorded and tested independent variables, namely age, gender, household size, education, house type, crop damages, livestock attacks, human attacks, village, circles and occupation. The ANCOVA test revealed that villages (p = 0.000), circles (p = 0.001), education (p = 0.012), human attacks (p = 0.003) and gender (p = 0.033) were significantly associated with their opinions. Whereas the socio-economic status of locals also had a role in shaping perceptions about the wildlife conservation. The respondents belonging to the lower socio-economic classes have the negative attitude while upper classes have a positive attitude. Our research suggests that primary (adjusted standardized residual: asr = 2.3) and middle school (asr = 2.7) educated male respondents consider wildlife as food resources (asr = 3.7). However, the graduates believed that wildlife has a role in ecological balance (asr = 6.6). The increase in wildlife attacks on humans is unlikely to support conservation (asr = 4.5).

Outdoor recreation specialists represent stakeholder groups that often rely on specific healthy ecosystems and have unique incentives to contribute to conservation and stewardship. We introduce the concept of habitat-dependent outdoor recreation conservation organizations (HDORCOs) and their potential to harness outdoor recreation enthusiasm to achieve ecosystem-scale conservation objectives. We identify potential roles for HDORCOs in nurturing pro-environmental attitudes and facilitating stewardship behavior among recreationists, focusing on examples from recreational fishing specialists and coastal marine ecosystems. While HDORCOs have achieved conservation outcomes in a range of settings, transferability across recreational specializations and ecological, cultural, socioeconomic, and governance contexts could remain challenging and potentially requires further development of the HDORCO concept. Communication with HDORCOs is one strategy to enhance engagement of recreationists, stakeholder groups not traditionally associated with pro-environmental behavior, in ecosystem-scale conservation efforts.

We supplement our analysis with qualitative information gathered on power and social ecological components of landscapes to enrich our understanding of natural resource systems. We find that power in Cambodia is concentrated in a central hierarchy, and external actors aiming to influence decision making would benefit from operating at multiple scales; there is no single leverage point for interventions. Cooperation between conservation and development actors is lacking; we observe that actors tend to cluster within similar groups. Cross-sectoral collaboration may be enhanced by knowledge brokers, but current actors lack resources to fulfil this role and require external support. Our study highlights the importance of nongovernment actors as conveners and facilitators to shape natural resource governance in the context of weak institutions.

Therefore, before attempting the optimal form of ecological restoration, we must know the key factors responsible for soil erosion risk and determine their impacts on the ecosystem health. To test this approach, we conducted a case study in the Three Gorges Reservoir Area from 1980 to 2015, where extensive restoration (primarily afforestation) has been conducted. The results showed that climate was most important during Period I (1980 to 1984), and explained 84% of the variation in erosion. However, vegetation became equally important during Period II (1985 to 2006), when it accounted for 51% of the variation. Climate became as important as vegetation during Period III (2007 to 2015), when it accounted for 51% of the variation.

Such spatially and temporally extensive datasets have been lacking for freshwater systems in comparison to terrestrial ones. Main types of variables contained The database includes 11,386 time-series of riverine fish community catch data, including 646,270 species-specific abundance records, together with metadata related to the geographical location and sampling methodology of each time-series. Spatial location and grain The database contains 11,072 unique sampling locations (stream reach), spanning 19 countries, five biogeographical realms and 402 hydrographical basins world-wide. Time period and grain The database encompasses the period 1951-2019. Each time-series is composed of a minimum of two yearly surveys (mean = 8 years) and represents a minimum time span of 10 years (mean = 19 years). Major taxa and level of measurement The database includes 944 species of ray-finned fishes (Class Actinopterygii). Software format csv. Main conclusion Our collective effort provides the most comprehensive long-term community database of riverine fishes to date. This unique database should interest ecologists who seek to understand the impacts of human activities on riverine fish biodiversity and to model and predict how fish communities will respond to future environmental change. Together, we hope it will promote advances in macroecological research in the freshwater realm.","[Comte, Lise; Giam, Xingli] Univ Tennessee, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Knoxville, TN USA; [Carvajal-Quintero, Juan; Tedesco, Pablo A.] Univ Paul Sabatier, Lab Evolut & Divers Biol, Inst Rech Dev, CNRS,Res Unit 5174, Toulouse, France; [Carvajal-Quintero, Juan] Inst Ecol AC, Lab Macroecol Evolut, Evolut, Xalapa, Veracruz, Mexico; [Brose, Ulrich] German Ctr Integrat Biodivers Res iDiv, Leipzig, Germany; [Brose, Ulrich] Friedrich Schiller Univ Jena, Inst Biodivers, Jena, Germany; [Eros, Tibor] Balaton Limnol Inst, Ctr Ecol Res, Tihany, Hungary; [Filipe, Ana F.] Univ Porto, Ctr Invest Biodivers & Recursos Genet, CIBIO InBIO, Vairao, Portugal; [Filipe, Ana F.] Univ Lisbon, Inst Super Agron, Lisbon, Portugal; [Fortin, Marie-Josee] Univ Toronto, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Irving, Katie] Leibniz Inst Freshwater Ecol & Inland Fisheries, Dept Ecosyst Res, Berlin, Germany; [Irving, Katie] Free Univ Berlin, Dept Biol Chem & Pharm, Berlin, Germany; [Jacquet, Claire] Swiss Fed Inst Aquat Sci & Technol, Dept Aquat Ecol, Dubendorf, Switzerland; [Jacquet, Claire] Univ Zurich, Dept Evolutionary Biol & Environm Studies, Zurich, Switzerland; [Larsen, Stefano] Univ Trento, Dept Civil Environm & Mech Engn, Trento, Italy; [Larsen, Stefano] Fdn Edmund Mach, Computat Biol Unit, Res & Innovat Ctr, San Michele All Adige, Italy; [Sharma, Sapna] York Univ, Dept Biol, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Ruhi, Albert] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Environm Sci Policy & Management, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Becker, Fernando G.] Univ Fed Rio Grande do Sul, Dept Ecol, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil; [Casatti, Lilian; Zeni, Jaquelini O.] Sao Paulo State Univ, UNESP, Dept Zool & Bot, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Castaldelli, Giuseppe; Gavioli, Anna] Univ Ferrara, Dept Life Sci & Biotechnol, Ferrara, Italy; [Dala-Corte, Renato B.] Univ Fed Goias, Dept Ecol, Goiania, Go, Brazil; [Davenport, Stephen R.] New Mexico Fish & Wildlife Conservat Off, Albuquerque, NM USA; [Franssen, Nathan R.] US Fish & Wildlife Serv, Albuquerque, NM USA; [Garcia-Berthou, Emili] Univ Girona, Inst Aquat Ecol, GRECO, Girona, Catalonia, Spain; [Gido, Keith B.] Kansas State Univ, Div Biol, Ackert Hall, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA; [Jimenez-Segura, Luz] Univ Antioquia, Inst Biol, Medellin, Colombia; [Leitao, Rafael P.] Fed Univ Minas Gerais UFMG, Dept Genet Ecol & Evolut, Lab Ecol Peixes, Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil; [McLarney, Bill; Meador, Jason] Mainspring Conservat Trust, Franklin, NC USA; [Milardi, Marco] Minist Primary Ind Manatu Ahu Matua, Fisheries New Zealand Tini Tangaroa, Wellington, New Zealand; [Moffatt, David B.] Ecosci Precinct, Dept Environm & Sci, Dutton Pk, Qld, Australia; [Occhi, Thiago V.

Accordingly, the objective of the Convention on Biological Diversity's recent Zero Draft Post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework is to sustainably meet the needs of people while reducing biodiversity loss. However, frequent failures in achieving this social-ecological balance necessitates more holistic, systematic, and adaptive post-2020 conservation interventions. The Theory of Change (ToC) approach provides a useful and flexible tool to support this endeavor. However, debate persists over its usefulness, and best manner of use. This paper explores the elements of, and proposes a framework for developing robust conservation ToC pathways. The framework emphasizes the importance of producing a shared vision of desired results and actions, and associated causal assumptions, among actors. Furthermore, evaluation is considered key to informing required ongoing adaptation to better achieve desired results. The paper also critically explores the challenges associated with ToC, and makes recommendations for its improved use in post-2020 conservation. In particular, we aim to inform the implementation and mainstreaming of the Post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework, especially at a national- and local-level. The framework and discussion should be relevant to a broad range of conservation actors at various scales that must address linked social and ecological objectives.","[Rice, Wayne Stanley; Sowman, Merle R.] Univ Cape Town, Dept Environm & Geog Sci, Private Bag X3, ZA-7701 Cape Town, South Africa; [Rice, Wayne Stanley; Bavinck, Maarten] Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam Inst Social Sci Res, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Bavinck, Maarten] UiT Arctic Univ Norway, Norwegian Coll Fisheries, Tromso, Norway",mr.waynerice@gmail.com,72,5,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",,CONSERV SCI PRACT,Conserv.

Terns nesting at inland colonies forage in freshwater during the breeding season and primarily in coastal marine environments during the nonbreeding season. As piscivores, they are susceptible to dietary Hg exposure. To characterize patterns of Hg exposure in this population, we 1) quantified within and among season differences in total mercury (THg) concentrations (mu g/g) in blood and feathers at 2 Lake Superior breeding colonies, and 2) documented spatial and temporal variation in exposure by studying adult foraging ecology using geospatial tracking devices and stable isotopes. We used general linear models to assess the relationship between isotopic composition and THg concentrations in bird tissues relative to sex, age, colony location, and season. The THg concentrations were lowest in winter-grown feathers (geometric mean [95% confidence limits]): 1.32 (1.09-1.59) mu g/g dw (n = 60), higher at the more industrially influenced colony (chick feathers: 4.95 [4.62-5.37] mu g/g dw [n = 20]), and increased with a riverine-based diet. During the breeding season, Hg exposure varied along a gradient from lake to river, with adult females having lower blood THg concentrations than males (females: 0.83 [0.67-1.03]) mu g/g ww (n = 7); males: 1.15 (0.92-1.45) mu g/g ww (n = 5). Stable isotope values suggested adults obtained 42 +/- 12% (n = 12) of their diet from the river during incubation, which was validated with tracking data. During chick-rearing, chicks obtained 68 +/- 19% (n = 44) of their diet from the river.

During the 1990s, field-level initiatives and national policy reforms across the region put it at the forefront of global experiments with community-based conservation. Community-based conservation, in theory and practice, is closely tied to institutional reforms that devolve rights over wildlife and natural resources to local communities. As such, these efforts have frequently encountered political-economic and institutional barriers that limited their impact. This contributed to a rising sense of rollback and recentralization of community conservation approaches during the 2000s. Since then, community-based conservation has expanded its scope considerably in some countries, notably Kenya and Namibia, primarily as a result of relatively supportive legal and policy provisions coupled with sustained government, civil society, and private sector support. At a wider scale, sufficient devolution of rights over wildlife and natural resources has been a chronic constraint, but community-based initiatives have still managed to persist, adapt, and deliver some evidence of positive ecological and social impacts in Zambia, Tanzania, and Zimbabwe. Three key overarching trends across the region are (a) the significant growth and expansion of community-based conservation where key institutional enabling conditions exist; (b) pervasive institutional limitations on community rights over wildlife and other valuable natural resources, which continue to constrain and undermine community-based approaches; and (c) local entrepreneurship and resilience that continues to create new opportunities for community-based approaches, even under adverse conditions.","[Nelson, Fred] Maliasili, POB 293, Underhill, VT 05489 USA; [Muyamwa-Mupeta, Patricia] Nature Conservancy, Johannesburg, South Africa; [Sulle, Emmanuel] Univ Western Cape, Inst Poverty Land & Agrarian Studies, Cape Town, South Africa; [Kaelo, Dickson] Kenya Wildlife Conservancies Assoc, Nairobi, Kenya; [Muyengwa, Shylock] Ctr Impact Evaluat & Res Design, Harare, Zimbabwe",fnelson@maliasili.org,59,4,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",,CONSERV SCI PRACT,Conserv.

Here we review guiding ecological principles of MPA network design and how they can be applied to the evaluation of MPA management measures for effective biodiversity conservation. We have developed a Qualitative Statement Framework that makes recommendations for applying ecological principles to MPA management measures, using the Scottish nature conservation MPA network as a case study. Our statements to guide MPA management measure evaluation relate to principles: representation, ecologically significant areas, rare, threatened or declining features replication, connectivity, adequacy/viability and resilience. We suggest that using the ecological principles for MPA design in management measure evaluation addresses a gap in current management evaluation tools. This approach would be particularly useful in situations where management measures are applied to MPAs post-designation and where MPAs are managed as zoned or multi-use sites.

To better understand several aspects of its ecology, in 2015 and 2017 the following parameters were assessed at six sites: plant density, habitat assessment (characteristics/disturbances), reproductive ecology (pollination biology, reproductive output, and flower visitors), predispersal seed predators, and seed germination. Overall we found that plant density and habitat characteristics/disturbances varied across time and among sites for Physaria kingii subsp. kaibabensis. In addition, this species requires pollinators for fruit and seed production. At the site level, fruit set, seed set, and seed germination, can be up to 73%, 39%, and 93%, respectively. Also, evidence was found for the presence of pre-dispersal seed predators and gall formers.

Sleep behaviour is likely to be subject to selection pressure and evolution, leading to sleep strategies to ensure survival during this vulnerable state. How sleep strategies of animals respond to alteration of macro-habitat has been largely unexplored. This study aimed to determine the effect of habitat type on the sleep ecology of the agamid lizardMonilesaurus rouxii. We carried out field work in the Western Ghats (India) biodiversity hotspot, in two differing habitat types-natural wet evergreen forests and human-modifiedAreca catechuplantations. We collected data on perches used by lizards for sleep, both in terms of their structural characteristics and their use (e.g. lizard head direction). To determine perch selection, we compared perch use with perch availability in both habitat types. Habitat type had limited influence on sleep perch selection ofM. rouxii, with lizards selecting only unstable narrow-girthed plants, suggesting a highly conserved sleep strategy driven by predator avoidance. The majority of sleeping lizards displayed an 'inward' head direction, towards the potential path of a predator approaching from the ground. However, this strategy to select for narrow-girthed plants constrained lizards to use lower, unsafe sleep perches in plantations (driven by availability), which could have consequences for their survival. To our knowledge, our study is the first to examine in detail the effect of habitat alteration on sleep strategies in lizards. Significance statement Sleep strategies of animals in the wild could affect their chances of survival and their performance during active behaviours. 'Where' and 'how' animals sleep are important aspects of their sleep strategy. However, it is unexplored if these choices would change in response to human modification of the natural habitat. We compared sleep site selection in the semi-arboreal agamid lizardMonilesaurus rouxiiin two different habitats (natural and human-modified). Lizards always chose narrow, unstable perch plants to sleep, as they allow for early detection of an approaching predator. In the human-modified habitat (Areca catechuplantations), opting for narrow unstable perches led to lizards using significantly lower perches, probably leaving them vulnerable to predators approaching from the ground. Our results show that exploring sleep strategies in the wild is necessary to properly assess the effects of habitat modification on species.","[Bors, Milena] Warsaw Univ Life Sci SGGW, Dept Anim Genet & Conservat, Inst Anim Sci, Ciszewskiego 8, PL-02786 Warsaw, Poland; [Mohanty, Nitya Prakash] Indian Inst Sci, Ctr Ecol Sci, Bangalore 560012, Karnataka, India; [Gowri Shankar, Pogiri] Kalinga Fdn, Shivamogga, Karnataka, India",nitya.mohanty@gmail.com,38,2,3,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0340-5443,BEHAV ECOL SOCIOBIOL,Behav.

Intentional and unintentional poisoning, human-wildlife conflict, energy infrastructure, belief-based use, and illegal hunting activities remain threats to vulture populations across Africa. Conservation stakeholders have identified evidence that a number of vulture species in particular ecosystems are being systematically targeted by poisoning with potentially significant effects on human, wildlife, and ecosystem health. We explored the extent to which an interdisciplinary, expert team-based approach linking conservation and criminology could help inform efforts to prevent poisoning of Africa's vultures. We used the case of illegal vulture poisoning and conservation in the Great Limpopo Transfrontier Conservation Area (GLTFCA), a known poisoning site, as an exemplar. We used an interdisciplinary framework, conservation criminology, to guide a desk assessment of how the local environment may create opportunities for illegal poisoning. Our assessment was conducted as a science team and included multiple iterations and structured discourse. The assessment identifies different elements of vulture poisoning and the opportunity factors that can both underly the problem and inform prevention strategies and tactics. We discuss controlling tools and weapons, extending local guardianship, denying benefits, reducing frustration and stress, and assisting compliance to help prevent illegal poisoning. Results provide insights into harm prevention using evidence-based theory and illustrate the positive potential of interdisciplinary team science for vulture conservation. With additional application, monitoring and evaluation, strategies and tactics explored in this desk assessment may be revised and implemented and portend other benefits for vulture conservation beyond poisoning; the spread of beneficial influence could be a welcome force multiplier for this important scavenger guild.

Existing studies mainly focus on how LUCC per se affects habitat quality, while less attention is paid to the integration of LUCC, socio-economic development and climate change as a land use system, and to investigate their synergistic impacts on habitat quality. This study addresses this issue by incorporating a top-down system dynamic model, a bottom-up cellular automata and a habitat quality assessment model. The potential impacts of urban growth, socio-economic development and climate change on habitat quality of Hubei Province, China, were predicted under the four IPCC RCP scenarios. Overall, construction land was predicted to expand fast whereas forested land and cultivated land to shrink significantly from 2015 to 2030, but RCP 2.6 and 4.5 scenarios may maintain higher habitat quality compared with RCP 6.0 and 8.5 scenarios. Severe habitat degradation is likely to occur in the megacity's surrounding ecosystems under RCP 2.6 and 8.5 scenarios, while the degradation is more likely to occur in middle-sized and small cities under RCP 4.5 and 6.0 scenarios. Further, our findings suggest that fixed asset investments and technology innovation play important roles in mitigating the negative impacts of urban and socio-economic development on habitat quality. This study should provide a useful approach for decision makers to design alternative development scenarios and to strike a balance between regional development and habitat conservation.","[Huang, Junlong; Tang, Zhuo; Liu, Dianfeng; He, Jianhua] Wuhan Univ, Sch Resource & Environm Sci, Wuhan 430079, Peoples R China; [Huang, Junlong] Univ Toronto, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Toronto, ON M5S 3B2, Canada; [Tang, Zhuo] Univ Iowa, Dept Geog & Sustainabil Sci, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA",markhuang@whu.edu.cn; zhuotang@uiowa.edu; liudianfeng@whu.edu.cn; hjianh@126.com,44,9,9,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0264-8377,LAND USE POLICY,Land Use Pol.,2020,,

Decision support frameworks (DSFs) are increasingly applied by resource managers to navigate the complexity, uncertainty, and differing socio-ecological objectives inherent to conservation problems. Most published conservation research that uses DSFs focuses on analytical stages (e.g., identifying an optimal decision), making it difficult to assess and learn from previous examples in a conservation practice context. Here, we (1) evaluate the relationship between the application of decision science and the resulting conservation outcomes, and (2) identify and address existing barriers to the application of DSFs to conservation practice. To do this, we develop a framework for evaluating conservation initiatives using decision science that emphasizes setting attainable goals, building momentum, and obtaining partner buy-in. We apply this framework to a systematic review of amphibian conservation decision support projects, including a followup survey of the pertinent conservation practitioners, stakeholders, and scientists. We found that all projects identified optimal solutions to reach stated objectives, but positive conservation outcomes were limited when implementation challenges arose. Further, we identified multiple barriers (e.g., dynamic and hierarchical leadership, scale complexity, limited resource availability) that can inhibit the progression from decision identification to action implementation (i.e., 'decision-implementation gap'), and to successful conservation outcomes. Based on these results, we provide potential actionable steps and avenues for future development of DSFs to facilitate the transition from decision to action and the realization of conservation successes.","[Wright, Alexander D.; Zipkin, Elise F.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Integrat Biol, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Wright, Alexander D.; Zipkin, Elise F.] Michigan State Univ, Ecol Evolutionary Biol & Behav Program, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Bernard, Riley F.; DiRenzo, Graziella, V] Penn State Univ, Dept Ecosyst Sci & Management, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Bernard, Riley F.; Braunagel, Taylor; DiRenzo, Graziella, V; Fleming, Jill; Brand, Adrianne B.; Grant, Evan H.

Using local ecological knowledge in combination with direct occurrence evidence, we assessed the distribution and abundance of the white-bellied pangolin (Phataginus tricuspis) and the giant pangolin (Smutsia gigantea) in Benin over the last two decades (1998-2018). We organised focus groups with local hunters in 312 villages within sampling units of 25 km x 25 km covering the whole country. Participatory maps of past and current geographic ranges of pangolins combined with direct evidence (96 collected scales) suggested that the white-bellied pangolin had a wide distribution and reached higher latitudes than previously known, whereas the giant pangolin could be restricted to a single forest and has been absent from the northern part of the country over at least the last two decades. Local hunters perceived a significant decline of the white-bellied pangolin (range contraction = 31% in 20 years) and almost unanimously an extirpation of the giant pangolin (93%), the latter being restricted to the Alibori forest reserve (northern Benin). Protected areas were identified as the main potential occurrence zones for pangolins: 77 and 100% of the potential geographic ranges of the white-bellied and the giant pangolins, respectively, overlapped partially or totally with the protected area network of Benin. Using a generalized linear model, we showed that the probability of reporting recent observations of the white-bellied pangolin was significantly higher for villages near protected areas and distant from main roads. The forests perceived as having sustainable populations of white-bellied pangolins were the Lama Forest reserve (southern Benin) and the complex comprising Monts Kouffe - Wari Maro - Oueme superieur (central Benin), a view that was supported by the great number of direct occurrence evidence collected in those areas. Overall, our study highlights an important geographic range contraction of the white-bellied pangolin and a possible entire extirpation of the giant pangolin over the last two decades in Benin.

This conservation assessment analyzes 77 ecoregions across the southern, settled part of Canada to identify priorities for conservation action. Our analysis included 34 measures of biodiversity, threat and conservation response. We categorized all ecoregions based on their overall biodiversity and threat scores. This categorization identified nine crisis ecoregions. These ecoregions have higher biodiversity and threat scores compared to other ecoregions in the study area. These ecoregions represent less than 5% of Canadian lands and inland waters but provide habitat for over 60% of Canada's species at risk. Twenty-one ecoregions have higher biodiversity but lower threat scores. Primarily distributed in the more intact portions of the study area, these ecoregions generally have lower biodiversity scores for species diversity, but score very high for intactness, habitat diversity and congregatory species. This assessment can help to contextualize existing and proposed conservation actions by highlighting key biodiversity, threat and conservation attributes of ecoregions across southern Canada. Our assessment can be used to focus efforts on new protected areas, species at risk recovery, capacity building and ecological monitoring. The results of the conservation assessment can be applied to set and track progress toward national, regional and organizational conservation goals, including post-2020 biodiversity targets.

Despite the persistence of highly diverse carnivore guilds, management idiosyncrasies are often orientated towards charismatic large predators and assemblage-level patterns remain largely unexplored. We conducted an extensive camera-trap survey in a natural quasi-experimental setting in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. We sampled across a protection gradient characterized by a provincial protected area (highest and formal protection status), a private ecotourism reserve, game ranches and traditional communal areas (lowest protected status). We evaluated assemblage-level and species-specific responses of free-ranging carnivores to the varying management contexts and associated environmental gradients. Despite similar assemblage composition between management contexts, site-scale carnivore richness and occupancy rates were greater in the formal protected area than adjacent private reserve and game ranches. Carnivore occupancy was more similar between these private wildlife areas, although putative problem species were more common in the private reserve, and contrasted with depauperate assemblages in least protected communal lands. Variation in carnivore occupancy probabilities was largely driven by land use contexts, that is, the level and nature of protection, relative to underlying fine-scale landscape attributes (e.g. distance to conservation fences) or apex predator populations. Synthesis and applications. Our findings provide convincing empirical support for the added value of multi-tenure conservation estates augmenting and connecting South Africa's protected areas. However, our emphasis on free-ranging carnivores exemplifies the importance of maintaining areas under long-term formal protection and the risks with viewing lucrative wildlife business as a conservation panacea. We suggest that unmanaged carnivore species be the formal components of carnivore reintroduction and recovery programmes to better gauge the complementary conservation role of South Africa's private land.","[Curveira-Santos, Goncalo; Santos-Reis, Margarida] Univ Lisbon, Fac Ciencias, Ctr Ecol Evolut & Environm Changes cE3c, Lisbon, Portugal; [Sutherland, Chris] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Environm Conservat, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; [Swanepoel, Lourens H.] Univ Venda, Sch Math & Nat Sci, Dept Zool, Thohoyandou, South Africa; [Swanepoel, Lourens H.] African Inst Conservat Ecol, Levubu, South Africa",gcurveirasantos@gmail.com,60,7,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8901,J APPL ECOL,J.

The global extent of marine protected areas (MPAs) has increased rapidly in the last decade, and monitoring and evaluation are now required for effective and adaptive management of these areas. 2. We classify monitoring in MPAs into four categories and identify a critically important, but undervalued category: human pressure monitoring that targets human activities and their impacts. 3. Human pressure monitoring is fundamental for interpreting the results of ecological performance monitoring and for evaluating MPA management effectiveness. The consequences of ecological performance monitoring that show unsuccessful MPA performance while falsely assuming successful mitigation of human pressures could jeopardize MPA performance analysis and adaptive management, and thus be worse than not monitoring at all. 4. Human pressure monitoring enables using MPAs as reference areas where the effects of global or regional pressures (e.g. climate change) can be disentangled from the effects of local human activities, as well as to minimize the shifting baseline phenomenon in defining healthy stocks. These benefits cannot be realized without active human pressure monitoring integrated into an adaptive management cycle that ensures effective MPA protection. 5. In the absence of human pressure monitoring, all ecological monitoring within MPAs falls in the ambient monitoring category: monitoring that is not intended to measure conservation outcomes. 6.

As with other taxa, effective conservation of amphibians needs to be supported by detailed scientific knowledge. However, species rich and broadly distributed taxa are typically characterized by high variability in research effort. Our objective was therefore to understand which factors (ecological and cultural) have led some amphibian species to be more researched than others. We used two proxies of research effort: i) the total number of articles on Web of Science (WoS) that mention the scientific name (or synonyms) of each species, and; ii) the number of conservation science articles on WoS that mention the scientific name (or synonyms) of each species. These measures were used as dependent variables in zero hurdle regression models with the aim of identifying the most important factors driving species-level knowledge production. Well researched species (generally, and for conservation) tend to have a longer history of scientific research, come from countries with high scientific capacity, have large body size, and to be present in man-made habitats. Endangered species tend to be less researched, generally and for conservation, possibly because they are often more difficult to study: many endangered amphibians are restricted to small, fragmented and remote habitats in countries with low scientific capacity. We conclude with a discussion of how taxonomic biases in research effort on amphibians can be addressed given the limited funds available for conservation research.","[da Silva, Arthur F.; Malhado, Ana C.

The objective of this work was to determine the potential forest fragments to interconnect in order to create a network of ecological corridors in Atlantic Forest, Espirito Santo State, using Fuzzy concept and least cost path analysis. First, by applying Fuzzy logic, we identified the potential forest fragments for ecological corridors implantation. Next, corridors were suggested based on the least cost path analysis, considering land use, declivity, permanent preservation areas (PPAs), and the 400 forest fragments with greatest ecological potential obtained by Fuzzy logic. A total of 33,105 forest fragments were recorded. Among these, considering combined classes very good and good, only 31.5% were considered suitable for ecological corridors implantation, highlighting the largest fragments within state. Lowest cost path methodology presented 76 routes of runners, with a 335.71 km total length and 63,515.86 ha total area.

The Chinese crested tern (Thalasseus bernsteini) is a critically endangered seabird with a global population of about 100 breeding adults and a breeding range restricted to the East China Sea and the Yellow Sea. In order to restore a breeding colony of Chinese crested terns in an archipelago where a former colony had been abandoned, social attraction (decoys and audio playback systems) was deployed on a small, uninhabited island with no history of seabird nesting. The objective was to establish a breeding colony of greater crested terns (T. bergii), a closely-related common species, in the hope that Chinese crested terns would follow. Thousands of greater crested terns and at least 19 Chinese crested terns colonized the island during the first breeding season after deployment of social attraction. After three years of successful breeding, the colony was abruptly abandoned early in the fourth breeding season because of invasive king rat snakes (Elaphe carinata), which consumed all tern eggs. Following removal of all snakes from the colony, terns resumed nesting the subsequent year. Recovery of this critically endangered seabird depends on repeating this process at multiple islands. Careful planning, in conjunction with habitat management, close colony monitoring, and deployment of social attraction, can establish a conservation network of suitable, secure colony sites where most breeding adults can reproduce successfully. This approach can be used to restore a variety of declining seabird species along the Chinese coastline.","[Lu, Yiwei; Fan, Zhongyong; Wang, Siyu; Yang, Jia; Chen, Shuihua] Zhejiang Museum Nat Hist, Hangzhou, Peoples R China; [Lu, Yiwei; Fan, Zhongyong; Wang, Siyu; Yang, Jia] Zhejiang Biodivers Res Ctr, Hangzhou, Peoples R China; [Roby, Daniel D.; Lyons, Donald E.] Oregon State Univ, Dept Fisheries & Wildlife, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Chan, Simba] Birdlife Int Asia Div, Tokyo, Japan; [Lyons, Donald E.] Natl Audubon Soc, Seabird Restorat Program, Corvallis, OR USA; [Hong, Chung-Hang; Yuan, Hsiao-Wei] Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Forestry & Resource Conservat, Taipei, Taiwan; [Zhou, Xiao; Chen, Dongdong] Zhejiang Normal Univ, Dept Chem & Life Sci, Jinhua, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Chen, Shuihua] Zhejiang Prov Museum, Hangzhou, Peoples R China",chensh@zmnh.com,28,2,2,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0006-3207,BIOL CONSERV,Biol.

To overcome the lack of information on species conservation status, multidimensional measures of species rarity can be used as proxies of species vulnerability. Under this assumption, a two-step protocol for site prioritization of aquatic groundwater-dependent ecosystems is proposed using invertebrate vulnerability estimated from species' traits. In the first step, each species occurring in the sites of interest are scored according to their vulnerability. In the second step, sites are prioritized using species' scores. Species vulnerability scores are based on five dimensions, for which various traits are scored: (i) geography, (ii) ecology, (iii) biology, (iv) population, and (v) evolutionary history. For each species, the scores of the various traits belonging to the same dimension are multiplied to obtain a synthetic score. These scores are then ranked into four classes and, for each dimension, each species receives a new score that reflects its rank. The sum of these scores represents the species' overall score. Site conservation priorities are assessed by combining species scores into three indices: Sum of Species Scores, Biodiversity Conservation Concern (which relates the sum of species scores with the local species richness) and Groundwater Biodiversity Concern (which is the average of the former two). The protocol is illustrated using case studies in Italy and it is fully implemented in the software AQUALIFE which is freely available at: by registered users. Sensitivity analyses showed that the protocol is robust against the lack of information on species biology or sampling limitations. However, trait scoring rests with the user, who must be familiar with the study group. This approach can be applied at any spatial scale and to different types of aquatic groundwater-dependent ecosystems.","[Fattorini, Simone; Fiasca, Barbara; Di Cicco, Mattia; Galassi, Diana M.

It is usually defined closely to the literal definition of integrity: being whole or unimpaired. Considering the deep changes our world is undergoing, we argue here for ecological indicators that are not restricted to naturalness targets. We propose a conceptual framework for so-called level-2 indicators of ecological integrity, that evaluate how the integrity of ecosystems is preserved given their naturalness context. We develop reference relationships between indicator and contextual variables and then assess how an ecosystem is doing, compared to others in similar contexts, by its distance to this reference. We explore two such relationships: the amount of aboveground phytomass an ecosystem stores in a given volume (biomass packing efficiency) and the mean patch size given the total habitat amount in the landscape (habitat connectivity). Using datasets at the national and worldwide scale, we show that these indicators are objective measures of ecological integrity that allow the comparison of plant stands and landscapes across different environmental and naturalness contexts. This framework provides a basis to evaluate if the state of an ecosystem is degrading and paves the way to a triage system prioritizing conservation and restoration actions.

The consequence of this blind spot means species with the most distinct ecological strategies might be lost. Here, we quantify ecological distinctiveness, based on six traits, for 10,960 bird and 5,278 mammal species, summarizing species-level ecological irreplaceability. We find that threatened birds and mammals are, on average, more ecologically distinct. Specific examples of ecologically distinct and highly threatened species are Great Indian Bustard, Amsterdam Albatross, Asian Elephant and Sumatran Rhinoceros. These species have potentially irreplaceable ecological roles and their loss could undermine the integrity of ecological processes and functions. Yet, we also identify ecologically distinct widespread generalists, such as Lesser Black-backed Gull and Wild Boar. These generalist species have distinct ecological strategies that allow them to thrive across multiple environments. Thus, we suggest that high ecological distinctiveness is associated with either high extinction risk or successful hypergeneralism. We also find that ecologically distinct species are generally charismatic (using a previous measure of public perceptions of charisma). We thus highlight a conservation opportunity: capitalizing on public preferences for charismatic species could provide support for the conservation of the most ecologically distinct birds and mammals. Overall, our prioritization framework supports the conservation of species with irreplaceable ecological strategies, complementing existing frameworks that target extinction risk and evolutionary distinctiveness.

We assess the conservation status and risk of ecosystem collapse for the Oyster Reef Ecosystem of Southern and Eastern Australia, which comprises two community sub-types established by Saccostrea glomerate (Sydney rock oyster) and Ostrea angasi (Australian flat oyster), consistent with the IUCN Red List of Ecosystems risk assessment process. We established: (i) key aspects of the ecosystem including: ecological description, biological characteristics, condition and collapse thresholds, natural and threatening processes; (ii) previous and current extent of occurrence and current area of occupancy; and (iii) its likelihood of collapse within the next 50-100 years. The most severe risk rating occurred for Criterion A: Reduction in Extent (since 1750) and Criterion D: Disruption of biotic processes (since 1750), although assessment varied from Least Concern to Critically Endangered amongst the four criteria assessed. Our overall assessment ranks the risk of collapse for the ecosystem (including both community sub-types) as Critically Endangered with a high degree of confidence. Our results suggest the need for rapid intervention to protect remaining reefs and undertake restoration at suitable sites. Several restoration projects have already demonstrated this is feasible, and Australia is well equipped with government policies and regulatory mechanisms to support the future conservation and recovery of temperate oyster ecosystems.

But not all species are equally sensitive to environmental changes. Specialist species are often considered more prone to extinction than generalist species. However, even considering the importance of the link between specialization and population trends of species (a potential proxy for extinction risk), only a few studies have provided evidence supporting this relationship. Here, we tested whether the population trend of breeding birds in Europe is linked to a specific category of species' specialization, using continuous measures of avian specialization based on a trait-approach. We focused on five different indices of avian specialization: diet, foraging behavior, foraging substrate, habitat selection, and nesting site selection. We calculated the mean value and the standard deviation of the population trend for 139 bird species. Then, we tested for the presence of a phylogenetic signal in bird population trends, in order to investigate if the tendency for related species to resemble each other, often demonstrated regarding phenotypes, is present also for the species' trends in Europe. We found evidence that bird species with negative trends were characterized by higher ecological specialization than species with positive trends. Specifically, population trends were negatively associated with nesting site specialization. We highlight that the species' degree of specialization can be used as a proxy for that species' ability to adapt and persist to environmental changes. Finally, the lack of a phylogenetic signal in either the mean value or standard deviation of the bird population trend suggests that the current status of a species is not strongly associated with the degree of phylogenetic relatedness.

In Colombia, montane regions are dominated by varying intensities of agriculture and high levels of biodiversity and endemism. Globally, Colombia has the second largest number of amphibian species and is also the third largest coffee producer. Our study region, the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta (SNSM), has high levels of amphibian endemism (38% and 10 threatened endemics) and is the fourth largest coffee growing region in Colombia. The SNSM rises from the sea to 5,775 m in just 42 km, with a direct overlap between coffee and amphibian habitat occurring across 600-1,800 m. We examined how land cover and elevation (from 800 to 3,700 m asl) influenced amphibian community structure, species richness, and abundance. We conducted surveys from September 2017 to July 2018 at 35 transects across five major land cover types: forest, ecotone, paramo, pasture, and shade coffee. In total, we recorded 19 species (366 individuals; 16 endemic species). Land cover was the main determinant of amphibian community structure, while the interaction between elevation and land cover was the main determinant of species richness and abundance. Forest and ecotone contained 73% of overall richness (14 species) with one species found exclusively in ecotone and three exclusively in forest. Pasture and coffee supported 42% (8 species) of species with only two species found exclusively at these land cover types. Shade coffee had low species richness and abundance and we detected just one endemic species in this land cover. The preservation of ecotone, transitional degraded habitat that occurs between two or more types of contiguous land cover types, represents an opportunity to safeguard microhabitats and microclimates. Conservation in the region should be collaborative and include private landowners, NGO's, government agencies, and academics. Conservation actions should prioritize protecting extant natural habitat, restoring degraded habitats, increasing the heterogeneity of production systems, and improving landscape connectivity and watershed health. To achieve those actions, local communities will require economic incentives to maintain forest cover and reduce the contamination of streams through agricultural runoff. (C) 2020 The Authors.

Understanding stakeholder perspectives towards wildlife is a key endeavour in this regard. In particular, it can be useful to separate notional or generic attitudes towards wildlife, from those that pertain to more practical considerations at localised scales. We assessed nuances in stakeholder attitudes and underlying beliefs towards the endangered Asian elephant Elephas maximus--a wide-ranging species that needs landscape-scale conservation, while also being an animal that is both culturally revered and conflict-prone. We instrumented semi-structured questionnaire surveys using a 5-point Likert score, to 2252 respondents representing tea estate labour and management across 17 estates in the Kaziranga-Karbi Anglong landscape of Assam, Northeast India. Respondents were overwhelmingly positive (80-98%) towards elephants notionally. In our landscape, this stemmed more from cultural links and beliefs about the animal's intrinsic right to persist, rather than utilitarian benefits in terms of ecosystem health. At localised scales, responses were more varied with issues relating to safety concerns and crop loss maximally inciting non-positive responses. Similarly, stakeholder attitudes towards elephant conservation at localised scales were varied. Elephant use of lands outside forests, for instance, incited equivocal responses. Interestingly, while safety concerns clearly limit the potential for human-elephant co-occurrence, stakeholders still believed that elephants do not harm people unprovoked; this highlights the opportunities a culture of tolerance provides for stakeholder support of, and engagement with, wildlife conservation. Ultimately, understanding stakeholder attitudes can determine our ability to encourage 'wildlife-friendly' behavioural change and shape human-wildlife interactions into the future.

Only through technological innovation can enterprises better realize water and energy saving and promote environmental sustainable development. As the second largest tax in China, corporate income tax affects the level of technological innovation through tax revenue and tax preference. In this paper, on the basis of theoretical analysis, the panel data of China from 1998 to 2017 were used to empirically test the impact of corporate income tax on the dynamics of technological innovation. The results show that the corporate income tax has significantly promoted the technological innovation in U shape to some extent, which was further proved by a threshold regression, that is, the short-term income backwardness mechanism and the implementation of tax preferential policies have significantly improved the level of technological innovation. However, with the increase of the burden of technological innovation of enterprises and the defects of tax preferential policies, the promotion level has been reduced. The long-term corporate income tax has reached a certain scale, which ensures the financial revenue and the government's efforts to optimize the allocation of tax resources, reasonably standardizes and plays the role of preferential policies, and increases its promotion role.","[Yang, Xiu; Li, Zhimin] Shandong Modern Univ, Jinan, Peoples R China; [Yuan, Wei] Hubei Univ Econ, Sch Business Adm, Wuhan, Peoples R China",vvsmile222999@163.com,8,0,0,COASTAL EDUCATION & RESEARCH FOUNDATION,COCONUT CREEK,"5130 NW 54TH STREET, COCONUT CREEK, FL 33073 USA",0749-0208,J COASTAL RES,J.

Despite the critical roles animals play in ecosystems, animals are often overlooked in assessments of ecological restoration success, particularly beyond their presence or absence in these habitats. Apex predators are critical to ecosystems, regulating predator-prey dynamics, and in arid Australia, monitor lizards (Reptilia: Varanidae) often fill high-order predatory roles. Varanids are highly diverse in size and occupy a variety of ecological niches, providing an ideal group for assessing habitat change over multiple spatial scales. Here, we assess the responses of varanids to early-stage habitat restoration following the discontinuation of mining activities, by mapping behavioural signs of habitat usage including burrows, tracks and diggings. We recorded burrow size and track measurements to gauge the size of varanids utilising reference and restored habitats, and mapped tortuosity of tracks to assess their movement through habitats. Restored areas had significantly fewer signs of varanid presence than the reference bushland and largely appeared to be just traversed or used only by larger individuals. Restored landscapes, particularly those in early successional stages, often lack established vegetation cover and present increased metabolic costs and predation risks. Providing fauna refuges (e.g. hollow logs) to mitigate the metabolic costs and predation risks in areas undergoing restoration may aid in facilitating the return of varanids and of other animal populations, particularly during the early stages of vegetation establishment. Understanding the behavioural responses and movement ecology of animals within landscapes undergoing restoration is key to facilitating the conservation of self-sustaining and functional ecosystems.","[Cross, Sophie L.; Tomlinson, Sean; Dixon, Kingsley W.] Curtin Univ, Sch Mol & Life Sci, ARC Ctr Mine Site Restorat, Kent St, Perth, WA 6102, Australia; [Craig, Michael D.] Univ Western Australia, Sch Biol Sci, Crawley, WA, Australia; [Craig, Michael D.] Murdoch Univ, Sch Vet & Life Sci, Murdoch, WA, Australia; [Bateman, Philip W.] Curtin Univ, Sch Mol & Life Sci, Behav Ecol Lab, Perth, WA, Australia",sophie.cross@postgrad.curtin.edu.au,93,3,3,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1442-9985,AUSTRAL ECOL,Austral Ecol.,2020,,

The goal of this paper is to further advance this area of research and provide new solutions to solve complex Spatial Conservation Planning (SCP) problems under uncertainty that consider risk preferences of decision makers. Our approach employs modern portfolio theory to address uncertainties in SCP problems, and involves two conflicting objectives: maximizing return and minimizing risk. We apply concepts from game theory such as the Nash bargaining solution to directly compute a desirable Pareto-optimal solution for the proposed bi-objective optimization formulation in natural resource management problems. We demonstrate with numerical examples that by directly computing a Nash bargaining solution, a Binary Quadratically Constrained Quadratic Program (BQCQP) can be solved. We show that our approach (implementable with commercial solvers such as CPLEX) can effectively solve the proposed BQCQP for much larger problems than previous approaches published in the ecological literature. Optimal solutions for problems with less than 400 parcels can be computed within a minute. Near optimal solutions (within at most 0.2% gap from an optimal solution) for high-dimensional problems involving up to 800 parcels can be computed within 8 h on a standard computer. We have presented a new approach to solve SCP optimization problems while considering uncertainty and risk tolerance of decision makers. Our new approach expands considerably the applicability of such SCP optimization methods to address real conservation problems.","[Sierra-Altamiranda, Alvaro; Charkhgard, Hadi] Univ S Florida, Dept Ind & Management Syst Engn, Tampa, FL 33620 USA; [Eaton, Mitchell] US Geol Survey, Southeast Climate Adaptat Sci Ctr, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA; [Martin, Julien; Yurek, Simeon] US Geol Survey, Wetland & Aquat Res Ctr, Gainesville, FL 32653 USA; [Udell, Bradley J.] Univ Florida, Wildlife Ecol & Conservat Dept, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA",hcharkhgard@usf.edu,50,5,5,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0304-3800,ECOL MODEL,Ecol.

Therefore, our objective was to investigate how the lack of information related to population viability impairs invasive species risk assessments. We built ENMs for the invasive slider turtle (Trachemys scripta) and compared the native and invaded portions of its niches. Both analyses were generated based on two approaches: a conservative one, which excluded occurrence records where the establishment of invasive populations was not confirmed; and a non-conservative one, which encompassed all occurrence records. Under the conservative approach, the niche similarity test revealed that the similitude between native and invasive populations was not different than the expected by chance. Conversely, under the non-conservative approach, the test revealed that native and invasive populations use a similar ecological niche, despite that the occupied portion of the species' niche during the invasion was quite larger than the native one. In fact, non-conservative models projected wider areas with high risk of invasion that were not detected by the conservative approach. While models' outcomes were markedly different, both provide valuable information in terms of evolution and conservation. We found that information about population viability is really valuable and should be incorporated in risk assessment, invasive records without this information should not be discarded under any point of view. Finally, we discussed the best way to consider this kind of information to assess the management of invasive species. (C) 2020 Associacao Brasileira de Ciencia Ecologica e Conservacao.

The allocation of resources to maintain peripheral populations is therefore often questioned. The sage-leaved rockrose (Cistus salviifolius L.) is a self-incompatible and obligate seeder widely distributed in the Mediterranean area but rare and patchily distributed in Switzerland at its range margin on the southern slopes of the Alps. Here, we combined analysis of genetic diversity with pollinator surveys and field studies of reproductive ecology to compare peripheral Cistus populations in the Alps with range central populations in the Mediterranean. Our results showed no differences in genetic diversity between peripheral and central populations and between fragmented and connected ones at its range margin in the Alps. Although the fragmented populations were visited by more abundant and species richer pollinators (bees and wasps), they showed lower number of seeds and higher self-compatibility compared to the connected ones, which excludes the pollination limitation hypothesis. Overall, our study highlights that peripheral populations of C. salviifolius in the Alps are likely to contribute to maintain genetic diversity, while showing variation in reproductive ecology, and are therefore important for the conservation of this species.","[Moretti, Marco; Caretti, Paolo; Bricalli, Anya] Swiss Fed Res Inst WSL, Biodivers & Conservat Ecol, CH-8903 Birmensdorf, Switzerland; [Caretti, Paolo] IBSA Inst Biochim SA, CH-6926 Montagnola, Switzerland; [Bricalli, Anya] Ufficio Nat & Paesaggio, Dipartimento Terr, CH-6501 Bellinzona, Switzerland; [Andrello, Marco] Univ Montpellier, CNRS, MARBEC, IFREMER,IRD, F-34200 Sete, France",marco.moretti@wsl.ch,64,2,2,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1385-0237,PLANT ECOL,Plant Ecol.,2020,,

In 2016, international protection of vulnerable smooth hammerhead sharks (Sphyrna zygaena) resulted in a seasonal fishing ban to protect juvenile sharks in Peru's small-scale fisheries. Richer data on the fisheries' social-ecological dynamics are necessary to understand fishery impacts and the ban's efficacy. Semi-structured interviews with 88 Peruvian gillnetters revealed that fishers are cognizant of their impacts on the hammerhead population and further, that historical fishery impacts on the species are more severe than reflected in official records. On balance, respondents welcome conservation measures: 76% of respondents were in favor of the ban. However, most respondents also voiced objections to the ban, with unfairness emerging as a central theme including with regards to impracticality, economic severity, ecological necessity, and the burden of compliance. These objections may directly and indirectly stem from a lack of transparency and fisher participation in the ban development-and-implementation process. Fishers suggested alternative or additional options for hammerhead management, such as minimum sizes or dynamic move-on spatial closures. These results point to the benefits of a participatory process that engages fishers in practical and more equitable conservation solutions.","[Mason, Julia G.; Crowder, Larry B.] Stanford Univ, Hopkins Marine Stn, 120 Ocean View Blvd, Pacific Grove, CA 93950 USA; [Alfaro-Shigueto, Joanna; Mangel, Jeffrey C.] ProDelphinus, Jose Galvez 780E, Lima 15074, Peru; [Alfaro-Shigueto, Joanna] Univ Cient Sur, Fac Biol Marina, Lima, Peru; [Mangel, Jeffrey C.] Univ Exeter, Penryn TR10 9FE, Cornwall, England; [Ardoin, Nicole M.] Stanford Univ, Grad Sch Educ, 485 Lasuen Mall, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Ardoin, Nicole M.] Stanford Univ, Woods Inst Environm, 473 Via Ortega, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",jmason@edf.org; jalfaros@scientifica.edu.pe; jeffrey_mangel@yahoo.com; larry.crowder@stanford.edu; nmardoin@stanford.edu,50,10,10,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0006-3207,BIOL CONSERV,Biol.

Reconstructing range dynamics through time and detecting their underlying causes can be helpful for present and future conservation actions. Black grouse (Lyrurus tetrix) populations have declined during the late 20th century in Northeast China, but the mechanisms are still unclear. We integrated species distribution models with long-term historical ecological records to reconstruct historical distributions of black grouse in Northeast China (1950s-2000s). Then, we prioritized the landscape for species protection based on the long-term historical potential distribution to improve the conservation management of this species. The area of potential distribution was 27.01% of the total study area in the 1950s, but the potential distribution in the 2000s was 16.39% of the study area. The range loss from the 1950s to the 2000s was 160,567 km(2), representing a 39.30% reduction. Within the study area, the species' potential distribution in the Changbai Mountains has gradually disappeared since the 1980s. Based on conservation prioritization analysis, the priority conservation area is 151,276 km(2), which is mainly distributed in the Greater and Lesser Khingan Mountains. National nature reserves only included 6.35% of the potential distribution of the black grouse in the 2000s.

The blunt-nosed leopard lizard (Gambelia sila) is a federally endangered species that, despite protection, remains in extremely arid, hot areas and may be at risk of extirpation due to climate change. We collected data on the field-active body temperatures, preferred body temperatures and upper thermal tolerance of G. sila. We then described available thermal habitat using biophysical models, which allowed us to (i) describe patterns in lizard body temperatures, microhabitat temperatures and lizard microhabitat use; (ii) quantify the lizards' thermoregulatory accuracy; (iii) calculate the number of hours they are currently thermally restricted in microhabitat use; (iv) project how the number of restricted hours will change in the future as ambient temperatures rise; and (v) assess the importance of giant kangaroo rat burrows and shade-providing shrubs in the current and projected future thermal ecology of G. sila. Lizards maintained fairly consistent daytime body temperatures over the course of the active season, and use of burrows and shrubs increased as the season progressed and ambient temperatures rose. During the hottest part of the year, lizards shuttledamongkangaroo rat burrows, shrubs, and open habitat to maintain body temperatures below their upper thermal tolerance, but, occasionally, higher than their preferred body temperature range. Lizards are restricted from staying in the open habitat for 75% of daylight hours and are forced to seek refuge under shrubs or burrows to avoid surpassing their upper thermal threshold. After applying climatic projections of 1 and 2 degrees C increases to 2018 ambient temperatures, G. sila will lose additional hours of activity time that could compound stressors faced by this population, potentially leading to extirpation.","[Ivey, Kathleen N.; Cornwall, Margaret; Crowell, Hayley; Taylor, Emily] Calif Polytech State Univ San Luis Obispo, Biol Sci Dept, 1 Grand Ave, San Luis Obispo, CA 93401 USA; [Ghazian, Nargol; Owen, Malory; Zuliani, Mario; Lortie, Christopher J.] York Univ, Dept Biol, 4700 Keele St, Toronto, ON M3J 1P3, Canada; [Nix, Emmeleia; Westphal, Michael] US Bur Land Management, Cent Coast Field Off, 940 2nd Ave, Marina, CA 93933 USA",ivey.kathleen@gmail.com,73,10,10,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",2051-1434,CONSERV PHYSIOL,Conserv.

However, assessing the relative impact of these phenomena is not straightforward, even in areas where phylogeography is well-studied, such as the California Floristic Province. Here, we use genome-wide markers to elucidate population genomic and phylgeographic patterns for a group of monophytophagous butterflies in southern California. This group is of high conservation interest because it includes the El Segundo blue, Euphilotes battoides allyni, one of the first insects listed under the U.S. Endangered Species Act, and a newly discovered population putatively assigned to E. b. allyni. Despite using the same unique host and coastal habitat, our results indicate that the newly discovered populations are not E. b. allyni and are more closely related to geographically proximate populations of the E. battoides group using a different habitat/host combination. Aside from E. b. allyni and the newly discovered populations, the rest of the group shows only fine-scale structure and apparently maintains genetic connectivity throughout southern California, across a vast range of habitats and climates, and on multiple hosts. Thus, habitat and host specialization did not elicit genetic isolation in neighboring populations suggesting that: (1) other phenomena are needed to explain the remarkable and idiosyncratic divergence of these highly restricted, proximate, taxa, and (2) fine-scale genomic markers suggest broader implications for understanding the mechanisms of speciation and reinvestigation of phylogeographic patterns in regions like the California Floristic Province.","[Dupuis, Julian R.] Univ Kentucky, Dept Entomol, Lexington, KY 40546 USA; [Dupuis, Julian R.; Rubinoff, Daniel] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Plant & Environm Protect Sci, 3050 Maile Way,310 Gilmore Hall, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Dupuis, Julian R.; Geib, Scott M.] USDA ARS, Daniel K Inouye US Pacific Basin Agr Res Ctr, Hilo, HI 96720 USA; [Osborne, Kendall H.] Osborne Biol Consulting, 6675 Ave Juan Diaz, Riverside, CA 92509 USA",julian.dupuis@uky.edu,105,7,7,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0960-3115,BIODIVERS CONSERV,Biodivers.

Location Mediterranean Sea. Methods Between 1993 and 2018, we investigated the spatial ecology of loggerhead turtles from rookeries in Cyprus and Greece using satellite telemetry (n = 55 adults) and SIA of three elements (n = 296). Results Satellite telemetry from both rookeries revealed the main foraging areas as the Adriatic region (Cyprus: 4% of individuals, Greece: 55%), Tunisian Plateau (Cyprus: 16%, Greece: 40%) and the eastern Mediterranean (Cyprus: 80%, Greece: 5%). Combining satellite telemetry and SIA allowed 64% of all nesting females to be assigned to; the Adriatic region (Cyprus: 2%, Greece: 38.5%), Tunisian Plateau (Cyprus: 47%, Greece: 38.5%) and the eastern Mediterranean (Cyprus: 51%, Greece: 23%), which are markedly different to proportions obtained using satellite telemetry. The proportion of the Cyprus nesting cohort using each foraging region did not change significantly, with the exception that individuals foraging in the Adriatic region are only present in the Cyprus nesting population from 2012. Repeat satellite tracking (n = 3) and temporal consistency in isotope ratios (n = 36) of Cyprus females, strongly suggest foraging ground fidelity over multiple decades. Main conclusions This study demonstrates the advantages of combining satellite telemetry and SIA to investigate spatial ecology at a population level. The importance of the Tunisian Plateau for foraging is demonstrated.

However, species have substantial variation in abundance across their range and migratory species have important spatiotemporal population dynamics. With growing ecological data and advancing analytics, both of these can be estimated and incorporated into spatial conservation planning. However, there is limited information on the degree to which including this information affects conservation planning. We compared the performance of systematic conservation prioritizations for different scenarios based on varying the input species' distributions by ecological metric (abundance distributions versus range maps) and temporal sampling resolution (weekly, monthly, or quarterly). We used the example of a community of 41 species of migratory shorebirds that breed in North America, and we used eBird data to produce weekly estimates of species' abundances and ranges. Abundance distributions at a monthly or weekly resolution led to prioritizations that most efficiently protected species throughout the full annual cycle. Conversely, spatial prioritizations based on species' ranges required more sites and left most species insufficiently protected for at least part of their annual cycle. Prioritizations with only quarterly species ranges were very inefficient as they needed to target 40% of species' ranges to include 10% of populations. We highlight the high value of abundance information for spatial conservation planning, which leads to more efficient and effective spatial prioritization for conservation. Overall, we provide evidence that spatial conservation planning for wide-ranging migratory species is most robust and efficient when informed by species' abundance information from the full annual cycle.","[Johnston, A.; Auer, T.; Fink, D.; Strimas-Mackey, M.; Ilife, M.; Rosenberg, K., V; Rodewald, A.

Haplotype-based comparative analyses of lineages occupying the same region, and thus subjected to similar environmental factors, allow decoupling shared evolutionary and ecological patterns, as well as multiple dimensions of adaptive diversification. Here we aimed to assess the role of environmental drivers on diversification of subtropical grassland, based on haplotypic diversity of two plant genera. We sampled two closely related and co-distributed grassland plant genera, Petunia and Calibrachoa, across their entire distribution area. Eigenvectors extracted from pairwise distances based on chloroplast DNA haplotypes were used to fit Phylogenetic Signal-Representation (PSR) curves to estimate evolutionary patterns in 19 bioclimatic variables and altitude. The PSR curves showed that altitude, precipitation, and temperature variables changed at different rates with haplotype differentiation. Altitude and temperature traits evolved under conditions closer to a neutral dynamics, whereas precipitation traits differentiated following more complex models. Our results indicated that the diversification in the two genera was more limited by precipitation conditions. Based on these novel findings, we suggest that future studies should test the possible impact of precipitation variables on the process of ecological differentiation in these genera.","[Barros, Michel J.

A recently emerged opportunity to examine several (n = 47) M. eregoodoo specimens bycaught in bather protection gillnets off New South Wales, Australia, together with new information assembled from other areas of its range, now allows for a redescription of the species, which was incompletely described in the past because of a paucity of specimens. Based on the morphometric, morphological, ecological, and behavioural elements presented here, corroborated by recent genetic investigations, we argue that M. eregoodoo (Cantor, 1849) is a valid species, distinct from shorthorned pygmy devil ray Mobula kuhlii (Muller & Henle, 1841). These findings are contrary to a recent revision of Mobula, where it was assessed as a synonym of M. kuhlii. The accuracy of taxonomic assessments underpins the effectiveness of species conservation, particularly when direct exploitation or bycatch in various fisheries needs to be managed for sustainability. Failing to recognize that two similar-looking species are distinct, such as M. eregoodoo and M. kuhlii, creates uncertainties that could result in mismanagement and underestimating local and global threats of extinction.","[di Sciara, Giuseppe Notarbartolo] Tethys Res Inst, Viale GB Gadio 2, I-20121 Milan, Italy; [Adnet, Sylvain] Univ Montpellier, EPHE, IRD, CNRS,Inst Sci Evolut, Montpellier, France; [Bennett, Mike; Laglbauer, Betty J.

From 2000 to 2012, we monitored understory plant communities in a woodland mosaic in Missouri, USA, as it underwent restoration via prescribed, dormant-season burning and mechanical thinning of red cedar (Juniperus virginiana) and exotic shrubs. Native species richness increased linearly by 36% over this time period, driven primarily by an influx of forb species in thin-soiled upland areas where red cedar was removed. Floristic quality also increased with differential dynamics across local communities; forest floristic quality saturated quickly whereas floristic quality increased gradually over the time series in woodlands and red cedar-dominated woodlands. Species that underlay these patterns were mainly ruderal or matrix forbs and grasses with little dependence on intact, undisturbed habitats. In contrast, conservative species were rare or absent. This case study suggests that understory plant recovery dynamics may be slower in harsher and more degraded sites and faster in more mesic sites within a woodland mosaic. Our observations set a benchmark for woodland understory plant recovery dynamics and indicate that a future restoration challenge is to prioritize the managed translocation of dispersal-limited, conservative species.","[Reid, J.

We assessed aquatic insect patterns of local contribution to beta diversity (LCBD) and species contribution to beta diversity (SCDB) in a Neotropical drainage network composed of both perennial and intermittent streams in a dry period. We evaluated if environmental and/or spatial predictors drive patterns of LCBD. We sampled aquatic insects in 12 intermittent headwater streams and 34 perennial streams. The intermittent compared to perennial streams had higher LCBDs and lower richness. The pure environmental component significantly explained 19% of the variation of LCBD, while the pure spatial components were not significant. Forty-six taxa contributed to beta diversity above the mean of the 199 taxa. We detected the association of oxygen tolerant and good dispersal ability taxa to intermittent streams and species riffle-adapted taxa as indicators of perennial streams. We showed a disproportional contribution of intermittent streams to the regional species pool. In summary, we demonstrated that when streams dry out, compositional uniqueness may increase during the dry period making them critical to conservation planning of dynamic stream networks.","[Valente-Neto, Francisco; da Silva, Fabio Henrique; Roque, Fabio de Oliveira] Univ Fed Mato Grosso do Sul, Lab Ecol, Caixa Postal 549, BR-79070900 Campo Grande, MS, Brazil; [da Silva, Fabio Henrique] Fundacao Univ Fed Grande Dourados, Fac Ciencias Biol & Ambientais, Programa Posgrad Entomol & Conservacao Biodiversi, Rodovia Dourados Itahum,Km 12,Unidade 2, BR-79804970 Dourados, MS, Brazil; [Covich, Alan P.] Univ Georgia, Odum Sch Ecol, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Roque, Fabio de Oliveira] James Cook Univ, Ctr Trop Environm & Sustainabil Sci TESS, Cairns, Qld 4878, Australia; [Roque, Fabio de Oliveira] James Cook Univ, Coll Sci & Engn, Cairns, Qld 4878, Australia",fvalenteneto@gmail.com,62,4,4,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0018-8158,HYDROBIOLOGIA,Hydrobiologia,2020,,

This study investigated and cataloged the traditional forage plant resources and recorded the associated traditional knowledge of immigrant villages in Hongsibu District of Ningxia, China. The diversity of traditional forage plant resources and the changes in associated traditional ecological knowledge were compared among ecological immigrant villages from different emigration areas, with a hope of providing a reference for forage development, the conservation of wild forage plant resources, and the development of regional animal husbandry. Methods: From March 2018 to May 2019, a field investigation was conducted in six villages in Ningxia. Through the snowball technique, a total of 315 immigrants were interviewed using various methods, including semistructured interviews and key person interviews, which included opportunities for free listing. The changes in the utilization of traditional forage plants were compared between the ecological migrants and the original inhabitants, and the causes underlying the changes were analyzed. In addition, the major forage plant species in the research area were investigated and evaluated. Results: (1) The six investigated villages reported 224 traditional forage plant species that belong to 42 families and 150 genera. Compared with their original living areas, the number of traditional forage plant species used in the immigrant villages decreased with the increase in the relocation distance. (2) The utilization of traditional forage plants varied among the immigrants who moved to Hongsibu District from forest areas, loess hilly areas, and semiarid desertified areas. The smaller the difference was in ecological environment between the immigration and emigration areas, the more the traditional forage plant knowledge had been retained. (3) The diversity and associated knowledge of traditional forage plants retained by ecological migrants are closely correlated to gender, age, education level, and occupation. Conclusion: This study revealed that the diversity of traditional forage plants and associated knowledge retained after migration vary among ecological immigrants from different areas; generally, the immigrants that relocated from a closer place retained more ecological knowledge. In the immigrant villages with significantly different natural resources and a long distance from the migrants' original locations, the diversity of traditional forage plants decreased, and the traditional knowledge about forage plants showed signs of being forgotten and abandoned by the younger generation. Therefore, measures are urgently needed to document and protect the forage plant resources and preserve the traditional knowledge of ecological immigrants.","[Ma, Ying; Luo, Binsheng; Feng, Jinchao; Xue, Dayuan] Minzu Univ China, Coll Life & Environm Sci, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Zhu, Qiang] Ningxia Forestry Res Inst, Yinchuan 750021, Ningxia, Peoples R China; [Ma, Dongxing] North Minzu Univ, Coll Math & Informat Sci, Yinchuan 750021, Ningxia, Peoples R China; [Wen, Qi] Ningxia Univ, Coll Resources & Environm, Yinchuan 750021, Ningxia, Peoples R China",xuedayuan@hotmail.com,66,4,4,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",,J ETHNOBIOL ETHNOMED,J.

Over a period of 120 days, and across the three ecological seasons, we recorded 981 roadkills (rate = 0.08 roadkill/km/day) from four vertebrate taxonomic groups. We generated predictive models of roadkill from one combined data set that considered eight variables identified from the literature as potential correlates of roadkill. The model that included the distance of the fence from the road, habitat type adjacent to the road, and the presence of a hill in the road (i.e., elevation) or a bank on the side of the road best explained roadkill occurrence. More roadkill was predicted to occur in both open and dense mopane and dense mixed bushveld habitats, on a hill, when there was a bank on the side of the road, and as the distance between the road verge and a fence decreased. Our model provides some insight into the significant predictors of roadkill occurrence and is therefore a valuable tool in identifying sites of high-potential roadkill frequency and formulating mitigation measures for reducing road mortalities.","[Collinson, Wendy J.; Davies-Mostert, Harriet T.] Endangered Wildlife Trust, Modderfontein, South Africa; [Collinson, Wendy J.; Parker, Daniel M.; Bernard, Ric T.

Distribution consequences for temperate coniferous forests during the Quaternary and future climatic fluctuations are little understood in China. Temperate coniferous forests are subdivided into two types where Pinus, Keteleeria, Tsuga and Cupressus species characterize the warm forests while Abies, Picea, Larix and Juniperus species characterize the cold forests. Both forest types were investigated using 12,675 unique records in the MaxEnt model to infer distribution patterns during six time periods: the present time, mid-Holocene, Last Glacial Maximum, Last Interglacial and the near- and far-future (2050, 2070). The results showed that the mean temperature of the driest quarter, followed by the temperature annual range and the precipitation of the warmest quarter were the most important variables controlling forests distribution. Suitable areas capable of supporting the presence of warm coniferous forests were highly contracted during the Quaternary; meanwhile, the cold coniferous forests expanded westwards from the last glacial maximum through the mid-Holocene to the present. The predicted future distributions showed a significant range-shift of warm forests northeastwards in response to climate change while cold coniferous forests are expected to migrate towards the Tibetan Plateau. Under increased global warming, the bioclimatic variables of the past and future periods were used as ecological indicators for the identification of areas showing climatic stability, and predicted to be refugia for coniferous forests and as good tools for conservation planning in Sichuan and the Hengduan-Tibetan migration corridor.","[Dakhil, Mohammed A.; Xiong, Qinli; Zhang, Lin; Pan, Kaiwen; Pandey, Bikram; Olatunji, Olusanya Abiodun; Tariq, Akash; Wu, Xiaogang; Zhang, Aiping; Tan, Xue; Huang, Dan] Chinese Acad Sci, Chengdu Inst Biol, CAS Key Lab Mt Ecol Restorat & Bioresource Utiliz, Chengdu 610041, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Dakhil, Mohammed A.; Xiong, Qinli; Zhang, Lin; Pan, Kaiwen; Pandey, Bikram; Olatunji, Olusanya Abiodun; Tariq, Akash; Wu, Xiaogang; Zhang, Aiping; Tan, Xue; Huang, Dan] Chinese Acad Sci, Chengdu Inst Biol, Ecol Restorat Biodivers Conservat Key Lab Sichuan, Chengdu 610041, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Dakhil, Mohammed A.; Pandey, Bikram] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100039, Peoples R China; [Dakhil, Mohammed A.; Farahat, Emad A.] Helwan Univ, Fac Sci, Bot & Microbiol Dept, Cairo 11790, Egypt",pankw@cib.ac.cn,68,26,26,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1470-160X,ECOL INDIC,Ecol.

Here, we developed a translocation program in which we capture pests and release ecosystem engineers, by relocating California ground squirrels Otospermophilus beecheyi from areas where they are unwanted to conserved lands where they can perform ecosystem services such as burrowing and vegetation alteration. We accomplished this using an experimental approach in which some factors were measured or experimentally manipulated, while others were held constant. We translocated 707 squirrels and examined survival and movement patterns as a function of several translocation tactics and ecological factors. We released squirrels at 9 different plots with varying ecological contexts and at each plot experimentally manipulated post-release habitat using mowing, mowing plus the use of augers to establish starter burrows, and controls that remained unmanipulated. The most influential variables affecting short-term survival, dispersal, and long-term persistence were factors relating to soils and vegetation structure. Translocated squirrels had higher initial survival on plots where dense exotic grasses were experimentally altered, greater dispersal when released at sites with less friable clay soils, and improved long-term persistence at sites characterized by more friable soils associated with metavolcanic than alluvial geological layers. Squirrel persistence was also improved when translocations supplemented previous translocation sites than during initial translocations to sites containing no resident squirrels. Our results demonstrate how California ground squirrels can be successfully translocated as part of a larger objective to favorably alter ecological function in novel grassland ecosystems dominated by non-native vegetation. In broader context, our study highlights the importance of testing release strategies, and examining habitat variables and restoration techniques more closely when selecting release sites to improve translocation outcomes.","[Swaisgood, R.

In this paper, the upstream and downstream of the river basin were treated as the subjects and objects of eco-compensation, and the mechanism of eco-compensation was clarified. The emergy analysis theory (EMA) was used to calculate the values of water resources in sub-industries (agriculture, industry, life, and recreation). The pollution loss rate theory (PLR) was adopted to calculate the water pollution loss rate in sub-industries. According to the value of water resources and pollution loss rate in sub-industries, combined with the water consumption of sub-industries in the river basin, the Ecological Compensation Quantification Model of Sub-industries (ECQ-Is Model) was constructed. Under the guidance of the aforementioned theory and model, a comprehensive research was conducted on the Xiaohong River. The results showed that the eco-compensation values of the upstream area, industry, and agriculture in the river basin were higher. Therefore, it is essential that the water resources in the Xiaohong River basin be well conserved and managed. In addition, the research results point out the direction for water pollution control, which includes promoting the coordinated development of the upstream and downstream, and maximizing the ecological benefits of the river basin.","[Guan, Xinjian; Hou, Shengling; Meng, Yu] Zhengzhou Univ, Sch Water Conservancy Sci & Engn, Zhengzhou 450001, Henan, Peoples R China; [Liu, Wenkang] China Water Resources & Hydropower Engn Bohai Con, Tianjin 300222, Peoples R China",mengyu8@zzu.cn,34,8,8,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0944-1344,ENVIRON SCI POLLUT R,Environ.

Doing so at the requisite scale and pace will require the efficient delivery of outreach campaigns. Conservation gains will be greatest when efforts are directed toward places of high conservation value (or need) and tailored to critical actors. Recent strategic conservation planning has relied primarily on spatial assessments of biophysical attributes, largely ignoring the human dimensions. Elsewhere, marketers, political campaigns, and others use microtargeting-predictive analytics of big data-to identify people most likely to respond positively to particular messages or interventions. Conservationists have not yet widely capitalized on these techniques. To investigate the effectiveness of microtargeting to improve conservation, we developed a propensity model to predict restoration behavior among 203,645 private landowners in a 5,200,000 ha study area in the Chesapeake Bay Watershed (U.S.A.). To isolate the additional value microtargeting may offer beyond geospatial prioritization, we analyzed a new high-resolution land-cover data set and cadastral data to identify private owners of riparian areas needing restoration. Subsequently, we developed and evaluated a restoration propensity model based on a database of landowners who had conducted restoration in the past and those who had not (n = 4978). Model validation in a parallel database (n = 4989) showed owners with the highest scorers for propensity to conduct restoration (i.e., top decile) were over twice as likely as average landowners to have conducted restoration (135%). These results demonstrate that microtargeting techniques can dramatically increase the efficiency and efficacy of conservation programs, above and beyond the advances offered by biophysical prioritizations alone, as well as facilitate more robust research of many social-ecological systems.","[Metcalf, Alexander L.; Phelan, Conor N.] Univ Montana, WA Franke Coll Forestry & Conservat, 440 CHCB,32 Campus Dr, Missoula, MT 59812 USA; [Pallai, Cassandra; Norton, Michael] Chesapeake Conservancy, 716 Giddings Ave, Annapolis, MD 21403 USA; [Yuhas, Ben] Yuhas Consulting Grp LLC, 121 Hawthorne Rd, Baltimore, MD 21210 USA; [Finley, James C.; Muth, Allyson] Penn State Univ, Ctr Private Forests, Ecosyst Sci & Management, Penn State 333 Forest Resources Bldg, University Pk, PA 16802 USA",alex.metcalf@umontana.edu,46,8,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0888-8892,CONSERV BIOL,Conserv.

As mature stands are targets for timber harvesting, the conservation of nest sites should be integrated into commercial forestry practices. Ecological data supporting conservation decisions are essential for ensuring effective conservation, and minimising costs and conflicts among different stakeholders. Here, we analysed nest site selection and nest site turnover patterns in a typical mature-forest-dwelling raptor in the core area of its global population. Our aim was to provide a basis for nesting habitat conservation in the context of commercial forestry. The lesser spotted eagle Clanga pomarina was found to prefer mature stands, located close to the forest's edge, for nesting. Pine stands were largely avoided by nesting pairs, but the composition of other tree species was similar to stands located in surrounding forests. The lesser spotted eagle occupied the nest for an average of three years, and the number of used nests within a territory increased progressively with the longevity of its occupation. Within a territory, the pair moved between alternate nests mostly up to 600 m. The results of this study suggest that long-term conservation approaches for mature-forest-dwelling raptors should use breeding territory, which contains several nest sites (or suitable stands) spaced at certain distances and covered by temporal buffer, as a target unit in conservation-supporting forestry practices.","[Bergmanis, Ugis; Amerika, Katrina] Joint Stock Co Latvias State Forests, Vainodes 1, LV-1004 Riga, Latvia; [Vali, Ulo] Estonian Univ Life Sci, Inst Agr & Environm Sci, Kreutzwaldi, EE-51014 Tartu, Estonia; [Treinys, Rimgaudas] Nat Res Ctr, Akad 2, LT-08412 Vilnius, Lithuania",rimga.t@gmail.com,62,3,4,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0378-1127,FOREST ECOL MANAG,For.

Using common vs. rare dung beetles and ants, we test how species rarity shapes richness patterns across a timber plantation mosaic with remnant natural grassland conservation corridors as a mitigation measure. We then determine how environmental and spatial factors shape assemblage composition of common and rare grassland species, and how matrix-derived species influence these patterns. For each taxon, species were ranked from common-to-rare, and from rare-to-common. This ranking gave sequences of species richness patterns for increasing numbers of species. Along each stage of these two sequences, species richness of the sub-assemblage was correlated with that of the whole assemblage. This was repeated with matrix-derived species excluded. Deconstructing the species response matrices according to species traits, variation in composition of common vs. rare grassland specialists, as well as in matrix-derived species, were related to environmental (natural environmental heterogeneity and habitat quality) and spatial factors. For both taxa, common species reflected overall species richness patterns better than rare species. Matrix-derived species reduced the contribution of rare species to species richness patterns of dung beetles. Environmental variables were relatively more important for rare species than for common species composition, especially rare ants. We found that in a fragmented landscape: 1) common species reflect overall species richness patterns better than rare species, 2) overall species richness patterns do not reflect those of rare species, 3) the relative influence of regional-and local-scale factors are determined by an organism's scale of life function, 4) rare species are especially affected by habitat quality, 5) knowledge of ecological processes governing communities in landscape mosaics are crucial for conserving grassland species diversity within these corridors.","[van Schalkwyk, J.; Pryke, J.

In the Cerrado biodiversity hotspot of central Brazil, Eucalyptus plantations increasingly claim large tracts of native habitats thanks to favorable soils, climate and booming pulp firm profits. Yet, the highs and lows of the economy including government incentives over the years riddled the landscape with abandoned plantations, which are not subject to active restoration. Despite the well-documented pattern anthropogenic disturbances negatively affect Cerrado biodiversity, little is known about the processes driving species co-existence within these abandoned plantations. Herein, we use phylogenetic community structure indices to test if potential processes assembling lizard communities differ between undisturbed Cerrado habitats and disturbed abandoned Eucalyptus plantations; and if so, are these processes predictable. In addition, we explore the applicability of phylogenetic community structure indices as ecological indicators of anthropogenic disturbance in the Cerrado biodiversity hotspot. We address these questions at a local scale, recording lizard species richness and abundance along transects of undisturbed Cerrado and adjacent disturbed abandoned Eucalyptus plantations. Morphological measurements were collected from captured lizards to test for trait conservatism. We investigated if phylogenetic community structure is altered in a predictable manner by comparing (i) phylogenetic species variability, (ii) phylogenetic species richness and (iii) phylogenetic species evenness. To test for significant differences between undisturbed and disturbed communities, we performed two-tailed paired t-tests for each phylogenetic community index. We also test for phylogenetic clustering and overdispersion to determine if potential processes assembling lizard communities differ between undisturbed and disturbed communities. Furthermore, we compare phylogenetic community structure indices to other commonly used diversity indices (taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic diversity) to evaluate their applicability as ecological indicators of anthropogenic disturbance in the Cerrado. We demonstrated phylogenetic clustering in two out of three of the undisturbed Cerrado lizard communities supporting habitat filtering as the potential dominant assembly process; whereas 67% of the disturbed Eucalyptus communities showed phylogenetic overdispersion supporting competition as the potential predominate assembly process. This indicates anthropogenic disturbance, in the form of abandoned Eucalyptus plantations, may alter phylogenetic community structure in a predictable manner, leading to the loss of closely related species in the disturbed plantation forests. The highly endemic biota of the Cerrado is composed of closely related species that share similar traits for survival, most likely a consequence of frequent episodic fires during the dry season. Interestingly, phylogenetic community structure indices and diversity indices did not converge on the same disturbed site to prioritize for active restoration; thereby, providing a cautionary tale on the applicability of the indices as ecological indicators for the Cerrado biodiversity.","[Gainsbury, Alison Melissa] Univ S Florida, Dept Biol Sci, St Petersburg, FL 33701 USA; [Colli, Guarino Rinaldi] Univ Brasilia, Dept Zool, BR-70910900 Brasilia, DF, Brazil",alisong@mail.usf.edu; grcolli@unb.br,73,0,0,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1470-160X,ECOL INDIC,Ecol.

Over the course of just a few years, deep learning has revolutionized several research fields such as bioinformatics and medicine with its flexibility and ability to process large and complex datasets. As ecological datasets are becoming larger and more complex, we believe these methods can be useful to ecologists as well. In this paper, we review existing implementations and show that deep learning has been used successfully to identify species, classify animal behaviour and estimate biodiversity in large datasets like camera-trap images, audio recordings and videos. We demonstrate that deep learning can be beneficial to most ecological disciplines, including applied contexts, such as management and conservation. We also identify common questions about how and when to use deep learning, such as what are the steps required to create a deep learning network, which tools are available to help, and what are the requirements in terms of data and computer power. We provide guidelines, recommendations and useful resources, including a reference flowchart to help ecologists get started with deep learning. We argue that at a time when automatic monitoring of populations and ecosystems generates a vast amount of data that cannot be effectively processed by humans anymore, deep learning could become a powerful reference tool for ecologists.","[Christin, Sylvain; Lecomte, Nicolas] Univ Moncton, Dept Biol, Canada Res Chair Polar & Boreal Ecol, Moncton, NB, Canada; [Hervet, Eric] Univ Moncton, Dept Comp Sci, Moncton, NB, Canada",nicolas.lecomte@umoncton.ca,81,102,104,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2041-210X,METHODS ECOL EVOL,Methods Ecol.

Explicit integration of the macroecology of human systems and natural systems has been rare, but can advance the incorporation of social justice, environmental justice and environmental equity into conservation biology and participatory conservation (inclusion in decision-making of those who are affected by, or can affect, that decision). The basis of this strong link is the focus of macroecology on the relations of a given biota to environmental patterns and processes, and these patterns and processes can affect humans differentially. Macroecological integration of social justice and conservation generally requires spatial and temporal representation of all variables at resolutions and extents that allow meaningful analyses. This requirement may facilitate clarity about social metrics and norms. To illustrate, we examine applications of macroecology to analysis of the effects of climate change on social justice and biological conservation; relations among climate, violence among humans and conservation; and the response of the spread of disease to social and ecological factors.

However, many studies revealed that the design and coverage of protected areas are still inadequate in representing key biodiversity features, are insufficient in the management approach to address the threats and pressures and have a low level of ecological integrity because of the increasing levels of environmental degradation. There is strong evidence of different anthropogenic pressures that deteriorate the effectiveness of existing protected areas, structurally, compositionally and functionally. Hence, the evaluation of a protected area's effectiveness is very crucial in maintaining long-term biodiversity conservation. Different evaluations have been carried out to assess the effectiveness of protected areas but focus only on certain issues or a single component. Current effectiveness evaluations still inadequately incorporate important criteria to make the evaluation of protected areas more comprehensive. Therefore, this paper will first focus on reviewing the current conditions and threats towards biodiversity conservation in tropical protected areas. Then, there will be a discussion on the relationship between the threats that cause issues with the effectiveness of protected areas. From issues that influence protected areas, the criteria or components that are crucial in developing the consolidated index model are identified. The main objective of this paper is to propose a consolidated index model that integrates the components of design and planning, ecological integrity and management to assess the conservation effectiveness of individual terrestrial protected areas in tropical regions.

Local, regional and global threats could have severe consequences for the future survival of many species and the provision of ecosystem services. In the face of myriad pressing environmental problems, we carried out a research prioritisation exercise involving 64 experts whose research relates to conservation biology and sustainability in SE Asia. Experts proposed the most pressing research questions which, if answered, would advance the goals of biodiversity conservation and sustainable development in SE Asia. We received a total of 333 questions through three rounds of elicitation, ranked them (by votes) following a workshop and grouped them into themes. The top 100 questions depict SE Asia as a region where strong pressures on biodiversity interact in complex and poorly understood ways. They point to a lack of information about multiple facets of the environment, while exposing the many threats to biodiversity and human wellbeing. The themes that emerged indicate the need to evaluate specific drivers of biodiversity loss (wildlife harvesting, agricultural expansion, climate change, infrastructure development, pollution) and even to identify which species and habitats are most at risk. They also suggest the need to study the effectiveness of practice-based solutions (protected areas, ecological restoration), the human dimension (social interventions, organisational systems and processes and, the impacts of biodiversity loss and conservation interventions on people). Finally, they highlight gaps in fundamental knowledge of ecosystem function. These 100 questions should help prioritise and coordinate research, conservation, education and outreach activities and the distribution of scarce conservation resources in SE Asia.","[Coleman, J.

Wetlands compose only 1-3% of these landscapes; however, large populations of migratory waterbirds rely on these wetlands to support energetically demanding life history events such as breeding and migration. Migration is considered a crucial period for birds associated with individual survival and reproductive success, yet our understanding of migration ecology remains limited. To better inform conservation planning supportive of these demands, we quantified synchrony of wetland flooding and waterbird migration by reconstructing bi-monthly surface water patterns from 1984 to 2015 across 11.4 million ha of the semi-arid Great Basin, USA. Results were then linked to seasonal migration chronologies for seven dabbling ducks species. Seasonal patterns were used in landscape planning simulations to assess efficiency in conservation strategies that aligned temporally sensitive wetland flooding and species migration. Wetland data were combined with land tenure to evaluate periodicity in waterfowl reliance on public and private lands. We found migration chronologies misaligned with wetland flooding. In spring, half (4359%) to three-quarters (68-74%) of seasonal wetlands were flooded and available to early-and latemigrating species while seasonal drying restricted wetland flooding to 13-20% of sites during fall migration. Simulations showed wetland conservation inconsiderate of temporal availability was only 67-75% efficient in meeting waterfowl habitat goals on private lands that made up similar to 70% of flooded wetland area in spring. Private-public wetland flooding was equivalent during fall migration. Accounting for spatiotemporal patterns of wetland flooding is imperative to improving efficiencies linked to migratory bird conservation. Timing of public-private wetland flooding, demonstrated by our models, provides landscape context that emphasized a joint role in supporting migratory waterbird habitat. Integrated management scenarios may capitalize on public lands' flexibility to expand fall flooding to offset seasonal drying on private lands while targeted incentive-based conservation assures private wetland flooding in spring. Such scenarios illustrate benefits of holistic public-private wetlands management representing a forward-looking alternative that aligns conservation with forecasts of increasing water scarcity.","[Donnelly, J.

In this paper, I revisit some of the central themes of disturbance ecology and argue that the knowledge established in the field of disturbance ecology continues to be relevant to ecosystem management, even with rapid changes to disturbance regimes and changing disturbance types in local ecosystems. Disturbance ecology has been tremendously successful over the past several decades at elucidating the interactions between disturbances, biodiversity, and ecosystems, and this knowledge can be leveraged in different contexts. Primarily, management in changing and uncertain conditions should be focused primarily on the long-term persistence of that native biodiversity that has evolved within the local disturbance regime and is likely to go extinct with rapid changes to disturbance intensity, frequency, and type. Where possible, conserving aspects of natural disturbance regimes will be vital to preserving functioning ecosystems and to that native biodiversity that requires disturbance for its continued existence, though these situations may become more limited over time. Finally, scientists must actively propose management policies that incorporate knowledge of disturbance ecology. Successful policies regarding changing disturbance regimes for biodiversity will not merely be reactive, and will recognize that for natural ecosystems as for human society, not all desired outcomes are simultaneously possible.","[Newman, Erica A.] Univ Arizona, Dept Ecol & Evolut Biol, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA",newmane@email.arizona.edu,57,34,34,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",2296-701X,FRONT ECOL EVOL,Front.

Scenario modelling can inform the possible outcomes of forest conservation policies, especially when the scenarios are rooted in the political dynamics that shaped the current legislation. In Chile, tree farms of non-native Radiata Pine and Eucalyptus provide a fast return on investment. Today, fast-growing plantations compete for land area with forest conservation, putting the unique bundle of ecosystem services provided by the latter at risk. Based on a previous political analysis, we propose scenarios projected to 2030 to compare a business-as-usual scenario with A) a conservation scenario based on strict land use restrictions B) an optimistic conservation scenario; C) an unrestricted industrial land use scenario; and D) a restricted industrial land use scenario. The scenarios differ in terms of the implemented policy instruments and the land area required for each land use. We compared these scenarios in terms of carbon stock, control of erosion and wood production, all of which are relevant in the current Chilean political debate. A conservation scenario (A), that combines incentives and restrictions, would imply the largest increase in native forest and regulation services, namely carbon stock and erosion control. In contrast, an unrestricted industrial land use scenario (C) leads to the worst outcomes in terms of erosion compared to a business-as-usual scenario. This study seeks to link political and economic processes underpinning land use change to environmental outcomes, while contributing to the larger discussion on forest policy, forest transitions and environmental outcomes.","[Manuschevich, Daniela] Univ Acad Humanismo Cristiano, Escuela Geog, Condell 343 Edificio A, Santiago, Chile; [Sarricolea, Pablo] Univ Chile, Dept Geog, Av Portugal 84, Santiago, Region Metropol, Chile; [Galleguillos, Mauricio] Univ Chile, Fac Agron Sci, Av Santa Rosa 11315, Santiago, Chile; [Galleguillos, Mauricio] Univ Chile, Ctr Climate Resilience Res CR2, Santiago, Chile",dmanuschevich@academia.cl,132,8,8,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0264-8377,LAND USE POLICY,Land Use Pol.,2019,,

To do this, we need to know where refuges are located, and when and which management actions are required to preserve, enhance or replicate them. Here we use a niche-based perspective to characterise refuges that are either fixed or shifting in location over ecological time scales (hours to centuries). We synthesise current knowledge of the role of fixed and shifting refuges, using threatened species examples where possible, and examine their relationships with stressors including drought, fire, introduced species, disease, and their interactions. Refuges often provide greater cover, water, food availability or protection from predators than other areas within the same landscapes. In many cases, landscape features provide refuge, but refuges can also arise through dynamic and shifting species interactions (e.g., mesopredator suppression). Elucidating the mechanisms by which species benefit from refuges can help guide the creation of new or artificial refuges. Importantly, we also need to recognise when refuges alone are insufficient to halt the decline of species, and where more intensive conservation intervention may be required. We argue that understanding the role of ecological refuges is an important part of strategies to stem further global biodiversity loss.","[Reside, April E.; Fisher, Diana O.] Univ Queensland, Sch Biol Sci, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia; [Reside, April E.; Kutt, Alex S.] Univ Queensland, Green Fire Sci, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia; [Briscoe, Natalie J.; Hradsky, Bronwyn A.; Kearney, Michael R.; Kutt, Alex S.; Skroblin, Anja; West, Matt] Univ Melbourne, Sch BioSci, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia; [Dickman, Chris R.; Greenville, Aaron C.] Univ Sydney, Sch Life & Environm Sci, Desert Ecol Res Grp, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; [Kark, Salit] Univ Queensland, Sch Biol Sci, Biodivers Res Grp, ARC Ctr Excellence Environm Decis, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia; [Kutt, Alex S.] Bush Heritage Australia, Level 1,395 Collins St, Melbourne, Vic 3000, Australia; [Nimmo, Dale G.] Charles Sturt Univ, Inst Land Water & Soc, Albury, NSW, Australia; [Pavey, Chris R.] CSIRO Land & Water, PMB 44, Winnellie, NT 0822, Australia; [Read, John L.] Univ Adelaide, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, Adelaide, SA, Australia; [Ritchie, Euan G.] Deakin Univ, Ctr Integrat Ecol, Burwood, Vic 3125, Australia; [Ritchie, Euan G.] Deakin Univ, Sch Life & Environm Sci, Burwood, Vic 3125, Australia; [Roshier, David] Australian Wildlife Conservancy, POB 6621,Halifax St, Adelaide, SA 5000, Australia; [Roshier, David] Univ New South Wales, Ctr Ecosyst Sci, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Stone, Zoe] Univ Queensland, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia",april.reside@gmail.com,159,23,23,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0960-3115,BIODIVERS CONSERV,Biodivers.

Local ecological knowledge (LEK) can often provide more extensive information on focal species and biological resources than is available from standard ecological surveys, and is increasingly recognized as an important source of data for conservation research and management, but it has rarely been used as a tool to assess the status of cetaceans. We investigated the efficacy of using LEK from local fishers combined with stranding records to characterise the diversity and distribution of coastal cetaceans in the northern South China Sea, a region with high historical levels of cetacean abundance and diversity but which is experiencing intensifying anthropogenic pressures. Fishers were unable to identify most regionally occurring cetaceans to species level. However, we were able to determine the distributions of eight categories of cetaceans that were observed by fishers, and a previously unknown population of Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin reported from the coastal waters of Hainan that was later confirmed through boat-based surveys. The number of sightings of different cetacean categories reported by fishers has a significant positive linear relationship with independent data on numbers of stranded cetaceans, validating the accuracy of our respondent data and indicating that LEK can provide useful, quantitative information on abundance rankings of different cetacean categories.","[Lin, Mingli; Xing, Luru; Fang, Liang; Li, Songhai] Chinese Acad Sci, Sanya Key Lab Marine Mammal & Marine Bioacoust, Inst Deep Sea Sci & Engn, Sanya, Hainan, Peoples R China; [Fang, Liang] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Marine Sci, Zhuhai, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Huang, Shiang-Lin] Shantou Univ, Coll Sci, Shantou, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Yao, Chiou-Ju] Natl Museum Nat Sci, Dept Biol, Taichung, Taiwan; [Turvey, Samuel T.] Zool Soc London, Inst Zool, Regents Pk, London, England; [Gozlan, Rodolphe E.] Univ Montpellier, CNRS, ISEM, IRD,EPHE, Montpellier, France",lish@idsse.ac.cn,57,11,11,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0964-5691,OCEAN COAST MANAGE,Ocean Coastal Manage.,2019,Green Submitted,

Predicting the future distributions of such organisms requires fine-tuned species-specific models. Building on a previous ecological niche model, we explored shifts in the suitability of habitats for the Endangered Andean cat Leopardus jacobita, and assessed how these will be represented within existing protected areas in the future. Using a robust set of presence records and corrected climate surfaces, we applied the Maxent algorithm to model habitat suitability for this carnivore and for its preferred prey, the mountain viscacha Lagidium viscacia. Our predictions indicate that the areas climatically suitable for Andean cats could contract by up to 30% by 2080 under the most pessimistic scenario, with an overall upwards shift of 225 m and a polewards displacement of 98-180 km. The predicted range contraction was more pronounced in the species' core range, in the Bolivian and Peruvian Andes, whereas suitable conditions may increase in the southern range in Patagonia. Bolivia and Peru are predicted to suffer the most marked decline in habitat representativeness within protected areas. The southern range appears to be less vulnerable to climate change, offering opportunities for the conservation of this genetically distinct population. We discuss the value and limitations of using species distribution modelling to assess changes in the potential distribution and conservation status of this and other Andean species.","[Bennett, Magdalena; Sillero-Zubiri, Claudio; Marino, Jorgelina] Univ Oxford, Recanati Kaplan Ctr, Zool Dept, Wildlife Conservat Res Unit, Tubney House, Tubney OX13 5QL, England; [Marquet, Pablo A.] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Ciencias Biol, Dept Ecol, Santiago, Chile; [Bennett, Magdalena] Univ Bernardo OHiggins, Ctr Invest Recursos Nat & Sustentabilidad, Santiago, Chile; [Marquet, Pablo A.] Inst Ecol & Biodiversidad, Santiago, Chile; [Marquet, Pablo A.] Lab Int Cambio Global, Santiago, Chile",mbennetm@uc.cl,57,5,5,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0030-6053,ORYX,Oryx,2019,Bronze,
