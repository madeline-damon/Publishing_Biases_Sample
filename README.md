# Publishing_Biases
This is a repository for my master's thesis code examining how racial and gender biases in academic publishing affects environmental knowledge.

Current code reflects a smaller sample of 1,000 Web of Science records published betweeen 2011 and 2021. Keywords used to attain search results include: wildlife, ecology, conservation, or biodiversity. The full dataset includes 50,000 article records, and final thesis code will be added as it is completed. For interest in specific proposal email madeline.damon@umontana.edu
